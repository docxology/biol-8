## Part A: Multiple Choice

### Mendelian Genetics Foundations

**1.** An alternate form of a gene is called a(n):
A) Chromosome
B) Allele
C) Genotype
D) Phenotype

**2.** What is the difference between a genotype and a phenotype?
A) They mean the same thing
B) Genotype is the genetic makeup; phenotype is the physical appearance
C) Genotype is the physical appearance; phenotype is the genetic makeup
D) Genotype only refers to dominant traits

**3.** An organism with two identical alleles for a trait (e.g., **BB**) is:
A) Heterozygous
B) Homozygous
C) Hemizygous
D) Polygenic

**4.** An organism with two different alleles for a trait (e.g., **Bb**) is:
A) Homozygous dominant
B) Homozygous recessive
C) Heterozygous
D) Codominant

**5.** Gregor Mendel is called the "Father of Genetics" because of his experiments with:
A) Fruit flies
B) Bacteria
C) Pea plants
D) Mice

### Punnett Squares & Crosses

**6.** In a cross between two heterozygous parents (**Aa × Aa**), what fraction of the offspring will show the recessive phenotype?
A) 1/4
B) 1/2
C) 3/4
D) All of them

**7.** In a cross between a heterozygous tall plant (**Tt**) and a short plant (**tt**), what percentage of offspring will be short?
A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 100%

**8.** A cross between a homozygous dominant (BB) and a homozygous recessive (bb) will produce offspring that are all:
A) BB
B) Bb
C) bb
D) A mix of BB and bb

**9.** A test cross is used to determine whether an organism showing the dominant phenotype is:
A) Male or female
B) Homozygous dominant or heterozygous
C) Alive or dead
D) Haploid or diploid

**10.** The Law of Segregation states that:
A) Genes on different chromosomes sort independently
B) Each parent passes on only one allele for each gene to each offspring
C) Dominant alleles are always expressed
D) All offspring are identical to the parents

### Extensions to Mendelian Genetics

**11.** When a cross between red flowers and white flowers produces ALL pink flowers, this is an example of:
A) Complete dominance
B) Codominance
C) Incomplete dominance
D) Sex-linked inheritance

**12.** If two pink flowers (**RW × RW**) are crossed, the phenotypic ratio of offspring will be:
A) All pink
B) 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White
C) 3 Red : 1 White
D) 1 Red : 1 White

**13.** Human blood type AB (genotype I^A I^B) is an example of:
A) Incomplete dominance
B) Codominance
C) Simple dominance
D) Polygenic inheritance

**14.** Traits like human height and skin color, which are controlled by many genes, demonstrate:
A) Simple dominance
B) Codominance
C) Polygenic inheritance
D) Sex-linked inheritance

### Sex Linkage & Pedigrees

**15.** Traits controlled by genes located on the X chromosome are called:
A) Autosomal traits
B) Sex-linked (X-linked) traits
C) Polygenic traits
D) Codominant traits

**16.** X-linked recessive disorders (like color blindness) are more common in males because:
A) Males have two X chromosomes
B) Males have only one X chromosome, so one recessive allele is enough to express the trait
C) The Y chromosome carries the allele for color blindness
D) Females cannot be color blind

**17.** A chart that tracks a genetic trait across multiple generations in a family is called a:
A) Karyotype
B) Punnett square
C) Pedigree
D) Genetic map

**18.** A carrier woman for color blindness (**X^C X^c**) has children with a man with normal vision (**X^C Y**). What is the probability that their sons will be color blind?
A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 100%

## Part B: Fill in the Blank

**19.** The allele that is expressed in the heterozygote is called _____________________, while the allele that is hidden (masked) is called _____________________.

**20.** The physical appearance of an organism is its _____________________, and its genetic makeup is its _____________________.

**21.** A cross involving two different traits at once (e.g., **AaBb × AaBb**) is called a _____________________ cross.

**22.** Human biological sex is determined by the _____________________ chromosomes. Females are __________ and males are __________.

**23.** In a pedigree chart, a filled-in circle represents a(n) _____________________, and a filled-in square represents a(n) _____________________.
