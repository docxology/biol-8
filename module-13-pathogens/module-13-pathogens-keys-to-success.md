# Module 13: Pathogens — Keys to Success

## Key Learning Objectives

### 1. Introduction to Pathogens
- Define pathogen and infectious disease
- Identify the major categories of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, prions)
- Explain how pathogens cause disease
- Describe routes of transmission

### 2. Bacteria
- Describe bacterial cell structure
- Compare gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
- Explain how bacteria cause disease (toxins, tissue damage)
- Describe beneficial bacteria and their roles
- Understand antibiotic mechanisms and resistance

### 3. Viruses
- Describe the structure of viruses
- Explain why viruses are considered non-living
- Describe the viral life cycle (lytic and lysogenic)
- Explain how viruses cause disease
- Understand antiviral treatments and vaccines

### 4. Fungi
- Describe fungal cell structure
- Identify common fungal infections
- Explain how fungi are transmitted and cause disease
- Understand antifungal treatments

### 5. Parasites and Prions
- Distinguish between protozoan and helminth parasites
- Describe common parasitic diseases
- Explain what prions are and how they cause disease

### 6. Body Defenses Against Pathogens
- Describe first-line defenses (skin, mucous membranes)
- Explain the inflammatory response
- Introduce the immune system's role in fighting infection
