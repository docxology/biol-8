# Module 9: Cell Division and Mitosis
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **The Cell Cycle**
    *   Name the three stages of interphase (G₁, S, G₂) and describe what occurs in each.
    *   List the four phases of mitosis in order: Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase.

2.  **Chromosome Structure**
    *   Distinguish between chromatin and chromosomes.
    *   After DNA replication, what are sister chromatids? When do they separate?

3.  **Cytokinesis**
    *   Compare cytokinesis in animal cells (cleavage furrow) and plant cells (cell plate).

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Cell Cycle Checkpoints**
    *   What are the three main checkpoints (G₁, G₂, M)? What is evaluated at each?
    *   Why are checkpoints critical for preventing cancer?

5.  **Cancer Biology**
    *   **Scenario**: A mutation inactivates the Rb (retinoblastoma) protein, a tumor suppressor.
    *   **Apply**: Predict the effect on cell division.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Mitosis vs. Cancer**
    *   Normal cells divide approximately 50 times before senescence (Hayflick limit). Cancer cells are "immortal." Analyze how telomerase reactivation contributes to this.

7.  **Binary Fission**
    *   Compare mitosis in eukaryotes with binary fission in prokaryotes. Which is faster? Why?
