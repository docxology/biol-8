# Module 7: Photosynthesis
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **The Big Picture**
    *   Write the balanced equation for photosynthesis: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂.
    *   Identify which molecule is reduced (CO₂ → glucose) and which is oxidized (H₂O → O₂).

2.  **Chloroplast Anatomy**
    *   Define thylakoid, granum, and stroma.
    *   Where do the Light Reactions occur? Where does the Calvin Cycle occur?

3.  **Pigments**
    *   Why are most plants green? Explain in terms of light absorption and reflection.
    *   What is the role of the antenna complex in photosystems?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **The Light Reactions**
    *   Trace the path of an electron from water to NADPH.
    *   Why is water split at Photosystem II? What byproduct is released?
    *   How is ATP generated? (Chemiosmosis driven by H⁺ gradient)

5.  **The Calvin Cycle**
    *   The Calvin Cycle produces G3P from CO₂. What two products from the Light Reactions are required?
    *   What is RuBisCO, and why is it considered the most abundant and important enzyme on Earth?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Evolutionary Adaptations**
    *   In hot, dry climates, stomatal closure leads to photorespiration. Analyze how C₄ and CAM plants solve this problem.
    *   Compare corn (C₄) and cactus (CAM) in terms of spatial vs. temporal separation of carbon fixation.

7.  **Global Impact**
    *   Photosynthesis removed CO₂ and added O₂ to Earth's early atmosphere. Analyze how this enabled the evolution of aerobic respiration.
