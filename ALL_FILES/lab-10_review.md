## Purpose

This lab is a structured, paper-based review to prepare you for **Exam 02**, which covers:

| Module | Topic | Key Concepts |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **07** | Genetics & DNA | DNA structure, replication, transcription, translation, mutations |
| **08** | Cell Division | Mitosis, meiosis, the cell cycle, comparison of both processes |
| **09** | Tissues | Four tissue types, structure-function relationships, locations |
| **10** | Inheritance | Mendelian laws, Punnett squares, pedigrees, sex-linked traits |

> **How to use this lab:** Work through each section systematically. The activities progress from recall → application → analysis → synthesis. Complete all fill-in tables and reflection questions honestly — this is practice for the exam.

### 3D. Tissue Identification Scenarios

For each description, identify the most likely tissue type and subtype:

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. You observe cells that are flat and scale-like, arranged in a single layer lining the inside of a blood vessel. What tissue is this?**

{fill:text}

**2. You observe long, cylindrical, multinucleated cells with visible striations (stripes). This tissue is:**

{fill:text}

**3. You observe cells scattered in a gel-like matrix with abundant collagen fibers running in all directions. This is most likely:**

{fill:text}

**4. A tissue sample shows branching, involuntary cells with intercalated discs connecting them. This is:**

{fill:text}

{fill:text}

## Part 4: Module 10 — Inheritance

### 4A. Mendel's Laws

Fill in the blanks:

<!-- lab:data-table rows=3 title="Mendel's Laws" -->
| Law | Statement | What It Predicts |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|
| **Law of Segregation** | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
| **Law of Independent Assortment** | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

---

### 4B. Monohybrid Cross Practice

**Scenario:** Freckles (F) are dominant over no freckles (f). Two heterozygous parents (Ff × Ff) have children.

**1. Complete the Punnett square:**

```
        F          f
   ┌──────────┬──────────┐
 F │          │          │
   ├──────────┼──────────┤
 f │          │          │
   └──────────┴──────────┘
```

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What fraction of offspring will have freckles?**

{fill:text}

**What fraction will be homozygous recessive (ff)?**

{fill:text}

**What is the genotypic ratio (AA : Aa : aa)?**

{fill:text}

**What is the phenotypic ratio (dominant : recessive)?**

{fill:text}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### 4C. Dihybrid Cross

**Scenario:** Smooth skin (S) is dominant over rough (s). Brown eyes (B) is dominant over blue (b). Two parents heterozygous for both traits cross: **SsBb × SsBb**.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**List all possible gametes each parent can produce:**

{fill:text}

**Using the 9:3:3:1 ratio, out of 16 offspring, how many would you expect to be:**

- Smooth skin AND blue eyes: {fill:number} / 16
- Rough skin AND brown eyes: {fill:number} / 16
- Rough skin AND blue eyes: {fill:number} / 16

### 4D. Pedigree Analysis

The following family has a history of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is **autosomal recessive** (let C = normal allele, c = CF allele).

```
Generation I:     □──○         □──○
                    |             |
Generation II:   □  ●  □─────○   ○
                              |
Generation III:             □   ○
```

*Legend: □ = unaffected male, ○ = unaffected female, ● = affected female. Lines between individuals indicate mating; vertical lines indicate offspring.*

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**The shaded individual in Generation II has CF. What is her genotype?**

{fill:text}

**What must the genotypes of her parents (Generation I) be?**

{fill:text}

**Her unaffected brother in Generation II marries an unaffected woman with no family history. What is the probability that their child (Generation III) will have CF? Show your reasoning.**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**Could CF appear in Generation III even if neither parent is known to be a carrier? Explain:**

{fill:textarea rows=2}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### 4E. Sex-Linked Inheritance

**Key Rule:** Genes on the X chromosome follow X-linked inheritance. Males (XY) only have one copy of X-linked genes, so they express whatever allele is present.

**Scenario:** Color blindness is **X-linked recessive** (X^B = normal vision, X^b = color blind).

**Cross:** Carrier female (X^B X^b) × Normal male (X^B Y)

**Complete the Punnett square:**

```
           X^B         Y
   ┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
X^B│              │              │
   ├──────────────┼──────────────┤
X^b│              │              │
   └──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What is the probability of a color-blind son?**

{fill:text}

**What is the probability of a color-blind daughter?**

{fill:text}

**Why are males much more commonly affected by X-linked recessive conditions than females?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**In hemophilia (also X-linked recessive), could a daughter be affected? Under what circumstances?**

## Part 5: Integration — Connecting the Modules

### 5A. Cross-Module Concept Map

On your scratch paper, **draw a concept map** (or complete the partial map below) that shows how the four modules are connected. Key relationships to include:

- DNA (Module 07) → controls cell function → required for cell division (Module 08)
- Cell division (Module 08) → meiosis → produces gametes → enables inheritance (Module 10)
- Inheritance (Module 10) → determines which genes are expressed → affects tissue development (Module 09)
- Mutations in DNA (Module 07) → can disrupt the cell cycle (Module 08) → can alter tissue type or function (Module 09)

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**In your own words, explain how a single mutation in a DNA repair gene (Module 07) could ultimately lead to uncontrolled cell division (Module 08). What is the medical term for this condition?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**Sickle cell disease is caused by a single point mutation (Module 07). It is inherited recessively (Module 10). The abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to sickle and clog capillaries. This affects which tissue types (Module 09)?**

### 5C. Final Synthesis Questions

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. What is the relationship between meiosis and Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment? (Which stage of meiosis directly explains this law?)**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**2. A cell has 2n = 46 chromosomes. After meiosis I is complete, how many chromosomes are in each cell? After meiosis II? Are these chromosomes duplicated (as sister chromatids) or single-stranded at those points?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**3. Two parents are both carriers (heterozygous) for an autosomal recessive condition. They have 4 children. Predict how many children you would expect to be affected. Does this mean exactly that number will be affected? Why or why not?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**4. Explain why stratified squamous epithelium is well-adapted for the skin (outer epidermis) but would be a poor choice for lining the lungs' alveoli (air sacs).**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**5. BONUS — Critical Thinking:** A woman is a carrier for an X-linked recessive condition. Her sister is also a carrier. They each have one son. For each son, what is the probability of being affected? If both sons are affected, is that evidence of a genetic link between the brothers, or just chance? Explain.
