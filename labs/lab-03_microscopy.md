## Introduction

The microscope is one of the most important tools in biology. It allows us to see structures invisible to the naked eye—from individual cells to microorganisms to the intricate details of tissues. The term "microscope" comes from the Greek words *mikros* (small) and *skopein* (to look at).

**Historical Note:** In 1665, Robert Hooke used an early microscope to observe cork and coined the term "cells" because the tiny compartments reminded him of monks' rooms (cells) in a monastery.

**Key Terms:**

- **Magnification**: How many times larger an object appears compared to its actual size
- **Resolution**: The ability to distinguish two close objects as separate (clarity)
- **Field of View (FOV)**: The circular area visible through the microscope

---

## Materials

- Compound light microscope (1 per student or pair)
- Prepared slides (cells, tissues)
- Blank glass slides and coverslips
- Lens paper
- Dropper bottle with water

## Part 1: Microscope Anatomy & Labeling

> **Learning Goal:** Become familiar with the parts of a compound light microscope and their functions.

Using the microscope at your station, examine its parts carefully. In the large box below, **draw your microscope** and label it using the terms from the list.

<!-- lab:drawing-area title="Microscope Drawing" height=500 -->

**Draw your compound light microscope here:**

{fill:drawing height=450}

<!-- /lab:drawing-area -->

### Terms to Label on Your Drawing

Use the following terms to label your drawing. Draw lines from each part to its label on your diagram.

| Term | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Eyepiece (Ocular Lens)** | Lens you look through; typically 10× magnification |
| **Objective Lenses** | Rotating lenses providing different magnifications (4×, 10×, 40×) |
| **Revolving Nosepiece** | Rotates to change objective lenses |
| **Stage** | Platform where the slide is placed |
| **Stage Clips** | Hold the slide in place on the stage |
| **Coarse Adjustment Knob** | Large knob for rough focusing (use only with low power) |
| **Fine Adjustment Knob** | Small knob for precise focusing |
| **Diaphragm/Iris** | Controls the amount of light passing through specimen |
| **Light Source** | Illuminates the specimen from below |
| **Arm** | Used to carry the microscope; connects body to base |
| **Base** | Bottom support of the microscope |

### Magnification Calculations

Calculate the total magnification for each objective lens. The eyepiece on your microscope is **10×**.

**Formula:** Total Magnification = Eyepiece Power × Objective Power

<!-- lab:data-table rows=3 title="Calculating Total Magnification" -->
| Objective Lens | Objective Power | Eyepiece Power | Total Magnification |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Scanning (red band) | 4× | 10× | {fill:number}× |
| Low Power (yellow band) | 10× | 10× | {fill:number}× |
| High Power (blue band) | 40× | 10× | {fill:number}× |

**Reflection Questions:**

1. Why should you always start focusing with the lowest power objective lens?

## Part 2: Observing Prepared Cell Slides

> **Learning Goal:** Practice proper microscopy technique while observing and accurately drawing biological cells.

### Proper Microscopy Procedure

1. **Always start with the lowest power objective (4×)**
2. Use **coarse adjustment** first, then **fine adjustment**
3. **Center the specimen** before switching to higher power
4. When switching to higher magnification:
   - Use **ONLY the fine adjustment knob** (never coarse!)
   - Adjust the **diaphragm** if the image is too bright or too dark
5. **Never use the coarse adjustment on high power** (40×)

## Part 4: Making Wet Mount Slides

> **Learning Goal:** Learn to prepare your own slides for microscopic observation.

### Wet Mount Procedure

1. Place a **clean glass slide** on a flat surface
2. Add **ONE small drop of water** to the center of the slide
3. Place the specimen **in the water drop**
4. Hold a coverslip at a **45° angle**, touching one edge to the water
5. **Slowly lower** the coverslip to avoid trapping air bubbles
6. Blot excess water with a paper towel if needed

**Tip:** If you see large circular objects that are all the same size, those are likely air bubbles, not cells!

## Quick Reference

### Magnification Formula

**Total Magnification = Eyepiece Power × Objective Power**

### Common Objective Lens Colors (may vary by manufacturer)

| Objective | Color Band | Magnification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Scanning | Red | 4× |
| Low Power | Yellow | 10× |
| High Power | Blue | 40× |

### Rules for Focusing

1. **START LOW** — Always begin with the lowest power objective
2. **COARSE FIRST** — Use coarse adjustment to find the specimen
3. **FINE FOCUS** — Use fine adjustment to sharpen the image
4. **HIGH POWER = FINE ONLY** — Never use coarse adjustment on 40× or higher

**Connection to Human Biology:** Understanding microscopy is fundamental to studying cells and tissues. The techniques you learned today—proper focusing, slide preparation, specimen drawing—will be essential for observing human cells, tissues, and microorganisms throughout this course. In medicine, microscopy is a critical diagnostic tool used for analyzing blood smears, tissue biopsies, and identifying pathogens.
