# Module 2 Study Guide: Cell Biology

## Key Terms

- **Cell**: Basic unit of life
- **Organelle**: Specialized structure within a cell
- **Prokaryote**: Cell without membrane-bound nucleus
- **Eukaryote**: Cell with membrane-bound nucleus
- **Nucleus**: Organelle containing DNA
- **Mitochondria**: Organelle producing ATP
- **Ribosome**: Site of protein synthesis
- **Diffusion**: Passive movement of molecules
- **Osmosis**: Diffusion of water
- **Active Transport**: Energy-requiring movement

## Organelle Functions

| Organelle | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Nucleus | Contains DNA, controls cell |
| Mitochondria | Produces energy (ATP) |
| Ribosomes | Synthesize proteins |
| ER | Protein and lipid processing |
| Golgi | Modifies and packages proteins |
| Lysosomes | Digest cellular waste |

## Study Questions

1. Compare and contrast prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
2. Describe the structure and function of the cell membrane.
3. Explain how materials move across cell membranes.
4. What is the role of each major organelle?
5. How do plant and animal cells differ?

## Important Concepts

- Cell theory and its components
- Structure and function of organelles
- Membrane transport mechanisms
- Differences between cell types
- Relationship between structure and function

## Practice

1. Label a diagram of a eukaryotic cell
2. Explain the process of osmosis
3. Compare active and passive transport
4. Describe protein synthesis pathway
