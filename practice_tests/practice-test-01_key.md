## Part C: Short Answer Key

**36. Characteristics of living things (any 3):**

- Cellular organization (made of cells)
- Metabolism (use energy)
- Homeostasis (maintain internal stability)
- Growth and development
- Reproduction
- Response to stimuli
- Adaptation

**37. Ionic vs. Covalent bonds:**

- Ionic bonds: electrons are transferred from one atom to another
- Covalent bonds: electrons are shared between atoms

**38. Four biomolecules:**

- Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, Nucleic Acids
- Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) store genetic information

**39. Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:**

- Prokaryotes: no nucleus, no membrane-bound organelles, smaller (ex: bacteria)
- Eukaryotes: have a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, larger (ex: plants, animals)
