Module 1 Lab: Ecosystem Observation

Objective

To observe and document ecological interactions in a local ecosystem.

Background

Field observations help us understand how organisms interact with each other and their environment. This lab involves observing a local ecosystem and documenting ecological relationships.

Materials

Field notebook
Pencil
Camera (optional)
Measuring tape
Thermometer
pH test strips
Magnifying glass

Safety

Be aware of your surroundings
Do not disturb wildlife
Watch for hazards (poisonous plants, animals)
Stay on designated paths
Work in pairs

Procedure

Part 1: Site Selection

Choose a study site (park, campus area, etc.)
Mark boundaries of study area
Note general characteristics (habitat type, location)

Part 2: Abiotic Factors

Measure and record:
Temperature (air and soil)
Light intensity
Soil pH
Moisture level
Wind conditions
Topography

Part 3: Biotic Factors

Observe and document:
Plant species present
Animal species observed
Evidence of animal activity (tracks, nests, etc.)
Interactions between organisms
Signs of competition or cooperation

Part 4: Food Web Construction

Identify producers
Identify primary consumers
Identify secondary consumers
Draw food web showing relationships
Note decomposers present

Data Collection

Create detailed field notes including:
Site description
Abiotic measurements
Species list
Interaction observations
Food web diagram
Photographs (if taken)

Analysis

How do abiotic factors influence the ecosystem?
What types of interactions did you observe?
How is energy flowing through this ecosystem?
What factors might limit population growth?

Conclusion

Summarize your observations and explain how they demonstrate ecological principles.
