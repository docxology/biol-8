## Part C: Short Answer Key

**36. Mitosis vs. Meiosis:**

- Mitosis: produces 2 identical diploid cells; for growth and repair
- Meiosis: produces 4 unique haploid cells; for sexual reproduction

**37. Muscular-Skeletal Interaction:**

- Bones provide support and attachment points for muscles
- Muscles contract and pull on bones to create movement at joints

**38. Blood Pathway:**

- Deoxygenated blood enters right atrium → right ventricle → pulmonary artery → lungs
- Oxygenated blood returns via pulmonary veins → left atrium → left ventricle → aorta

**39. Gas Exchange:**

- O2 diffuses from alveoli into blood (binds to hemoglobin)
- CO2 diffuses from blood into alveoli and is exhaled

**40. Defense Against Pathogens (any 2):**

- Physical barriers (skin, mucus membranes)
- Immune cells (white blood cells, antibodies)
- Inflammatory response
