Module 3 Lab: Climate Data Analysis

Objective

To analyze climate data and identify trends related to climate change.

Background

Long-term climate data reveal patterns and trends that help us understand climate change. This lab involves analyzing temperature and precipitation data.

Materials

Climate data sets (provided)
Computer with spreadsheet software
Calculator
Graph paper or graphing software

Procedure

Part 1: Temperature Analysis

Obtain temperature data for your region (last 50+ years)
Calculate annual average temperatures
Create line graph showing temperature trends
Calculate rate of change
Identify patterns

Part 2: Precipitation Analysis

Obtain precipitation data for same period
Calculate annual totals
Create graph showing precipitation trends
Identify wet and dry periods
Compare to temperature trends

Part 3: Extreme Events

Identify extreme temperature events
Identify extreme precipitation events
Count frequency over time
Analyze trends in extremes
Compare to historical averages

Part 4: Correlation Analysis

Compare temperature and precipitation
Look for relationships
Identify anomalies
Discuss possible causes

Data Analysis

Create:
Temperature trend graph
Precipitation trend graph
Extreme event frequency chart
Summary statistics table

Questions

What temperature trends do you observe?
How has precipitation changed?
Are extreme events increasing?
What might explain these patterns?
How do local trends compare to global?

Conclusion

Summarize findings and explain their significance for understanding climate change.
