B) Prophase, Anaphase, Metaphase, Telophase
C) Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase
D) Telophase, Anaphase, Metaphase, Prophase

**3.** During which phase do chromosomes line up at the center (equator) of the cell?
A) Prophase
B) Metaphase
C) Anaphase
D) Telophase

**4.** The end product of mitosis is:
A) Two genetically identical diploid cells
B) Four genetically unique haploid cells
C) Two unique diploid cells
D) Four identical haploid cells

**5.** Meiosis occurs in:
A) All body cells (somatic cells)
B) Only germ cells (to produce gametes)
C) Only bacteria
D) Skin cells for repair

**6.** Crossing over, which increases genetic diversity, occurs during:
A) Prophase of Mitosis
B) Prophase I of Meiosis
C) Metaphase II of Meiosis
D) Cytokinesis

**7.** If a human skin cell has 46 chromosomes, how many chromosomes will a sperm cell have?
A) 46
B) 92
C) 23
D) 12

**8.** Nondisjunction is the failure of chromosomes to separate, which can lead to:
A) Cancer
B) Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)
C) Identical twins
D) Faster cell division

### Module 9: Inheritance

**9.** An alternate form of a gene is called a(n):
A) Chromosome
B) Allele
C) Genotype
D) Phenotype

**10.** If an individual has two identical alleles for a trait (e.g., **AA**), they are:
A) Heterozygous
B) Homozygous dominant
C) Homozygous recessive
D) Hemizygous

**11.** In a cross between a heterozygous tall plant (Tt) and a short plant (tt), what is the probability of having short offspring?
A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 100%

**12.** Which inheritance pattern results in an intermediate phenotype (e.g., Red x White = Pink)?
A) Complete dominance
B) Codominance
C) Incomplete dominance
D) X-linked inheritance

**13.** Blood type AB (genotype I^A I^B) is an example of:
A) Incomplete dominance
B) Codominance
C) Simple dominance
D) Sex-linked inheritance

**14.** Traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome are called:
A) Autosomal traits
B) Sex-linked traits
C) Polygenic traits
D) Multiple alleles

**15.** Why are X-linked recessive disorders (like color blindness) more common in males?
A) Males have two X chromosomes
B) Males have only one X chromosome, so there is no dominant allele to mask the recessive one
C) The Y chromosome carries the disorder
D) Males have weaker immune systems

**16.** A chart that tracks a trait across generations in a family is called a:
A) Karyotype
B) Punnett Square
C) Pedigree
D) Genetic map

**17.** The division of the cytoplasm at the end of cell division is called _____________________.

**18.** Mitosis produces cells for growth and repair, while meiosis produces _____________________.

**19.** Uncontrolled cell division is known as _____________________.

**20.** Gregor Mendel represents the "Father of _____________________."

**21.** The physical appearance of an organism is its _____________________, while its genetic makeup is its _____________________.

**22.** In a heterozygote, the allele that is masked (hidden) is called _____________________.
