Module 11: Skeletal System — Keys to Success

Key Learning Objectives

Functions of the Skeletal System
Identify the five major functions (support, protection, movement, mineral storage, blood cell formation)
Explain how bones contribute to calcium homeostasis
Describe the role of red bone marrow in hematopoiesis

Bone Structure
Describe the structure of a long bone (diaphysis, epiphysis, periosteum, medullary cavity)
Compare compact bone and spongy bone
Explain the organization of osteons (Haversian systems)
Identify the components of bone tissue (osteocytes, matrix, collagen, minerals)

Bone Cells and Remodeling
Describe the functions of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts
Explain bone remodeling and its importance
Understand how bones adapt to mechanical stress
Describe factors affecting bone health

Bone Development and Growth
Compare intramembranous and endochondral ossification
Explain how bones grow in length and diameter
Describe the structure and function of the epiphyseal plate
Understand the effects of hormones on bone growth

Divisions of the Skeleton
Distinguish between the axial and appendicular skeleton
Identify major bones in each division
Describe the structure and function of different joint types

Common Skeletal Disorders
Describe osteoporosis and its risk factors
Explain fractures and the healing process
Understand arthritis and other joint disorders

Study Tips

Use skeleton models for bone identification
Create labeled diagrams of bone structure
Study bone cell functions with visual aids
Practice naming bones systematically
Connect bone disorders to their underlying causes
