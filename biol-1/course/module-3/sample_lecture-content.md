# Module 3: Genetics and Heredity

## Introduction to Genetics

Genetics is the study of heredity and variation in living organisms. This module covers how traits are passed from parents to offspring.

## Mendelian Genetics

Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants established the fundamental principles of inheritance.

### Key Principles

1. **Law of Segregation**: Each individual has two alleles for each gene, and these separate during gamete formation
2. **Law of Independent Assortment**: Genes for different traits assort independently during gamete formation

### Genetic Terminology

- **Gene**: Unit of heredity
- **Allele**: Variant form of a gene
- **Genotype**: Genetic makeup of an organism
- **Phenotype**: Observable characteristics
- **Dominant**: Allele that masks the effect of another
- **Recessive**: Allele whose effect is masked
- **Homozygous**: Having two identical alleles
- **Heterozygous**: Having two different alleles

## Punnett Squares

Punnett squares are used to predict the probability of offspring genotypes and phenotypes from parental crosses.

### Example: Monohybrid Cross

Crossing two heterozygous individuals (Aa × Aa):
- 25% AA (homozygous dominant)
- 50% Aa (heterozygous)
- 25% aa (homozygous recessive)

Phenotypic ratio: 3:1 (dominant:recessive)

## DNA Structure

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information:

- Double helix structure
- Composed of nucleotides
- Four bases: Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, Cytosine
- Base pairing: A-T, G-C

## Chromosomes and Inheritance

- Chromosomes carry genes
- Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes
- Sex chromosomes determine biological sex
- Autosomes are non-sex chromosomes

## Genetic Disorders

Some genetic disorders result from mutations or chromosomal abnormalities:
- Single gene disorders (e.g., cystic fibrosis)
- Chromosomal disorders (e.g., Down syndrome)
- Multifactorial disorders (e.g., diabetes)
