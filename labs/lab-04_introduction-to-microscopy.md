## Introduction

The microscope is one of the most important tools in biology. It allows us to see structures that are invisible to the naked eye—from cells to microorganisms to the intricate details of tissues. In this lab, you'll learn proper microscopy techniques, including how to focus, calculate magnification, estimate specimen size, and prepare your own slides.

**Historical Note:** The first microscopes were developed in the late 1500s. In 1665, Robert Hooke used an early microscope to observe cork and coined the term "cells."

**Key Terms:**

- **Magnification**: How many times larger an object appears
- **Resolution**: The ability to distinguish two close objects as separate
- **Field of view**: The circular area visible through the microscope

<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Magnification Levels

Your microscope has multiple objective lenses:

<!-- lab:data-table rows=4 title="Objective Lens Magnification" -->
| Objective Lens | Objective Power | Eyepiece Power | Total Magnification |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Scanning      | 4×             | 10×            | {fill:number}× |
| Low power     | 10×            | 10×            | {fill:number}× |
| High power    | 40×            | 10×            | {fill:number}× |
| Oil immersion (if available) | 100× | 10×       | {fill:number}× |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

**Calculating Total Magnification:**

```
Total Magnification = Eyepiece Power × Objective Power

Example: 10× eyepiece × 40× objective = 400× total magnification
```

## Part 2: The Letter "e" Observation

> **Learning Goal:** Discover how the microscope inverts images and how to move specimens.

### Background

The compound microscope creates an image that is both **inverted** (upside down) and **reversed** (left/right flipped). This affects how you move slides to keep specimens in view.

### Procedure

1. Obtain a prepared slide with a letter "e" (or cut a small letter "e" from newspaper)
2. Place the slide on the stage with the "e" right-side up and readable
3. Start with the lowest power objective (4× or 10×)
4. Focus carefully using coarse then fine adjustment
5. Observe and record how the letter appears

### Data Collection

<!-- lab:data-table rows=1 title="Letter 'e' Observations" -->
| How does the letter "e" appear? | Sketch what you see through the microscope |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Right-side up or upside down? | {fill:text} |
| Normal or reversed (mirror image)? | {fill:text} |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

**Draw the letter "e" as it appears on the slide (naked eye) and through the microscope:**

| As placed on stage | As seen through microscope |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| e                 | {fill:text}               |

### Movement Investigation

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**When you move the slide to the RIGHT, which direction does the image move?**

{fill:text}

**When you move the slide AWAY from you (up), which direction does the image move?**

{fill:text}

**Why does this happen? Explain in terms of how light passes through the microscope:**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**Practical implication: If a specimen you want to view is in the upper right corner of the field of view, which direction should you move the slide?**

## Part 3: Calculating Specimen Size

> **Learning Goal:** Learn to estimate the actual size of microscopic objects using field of view diameter.

### Background

To calculate specimen size, we first need to know the **field of view diameter** at each magnification.

**Key relationships:**

- Higher magnification = smaller field of view
- Field of view diameter and magnification are inversely proportional

### Measuring Field of View

Place a transparent metric ruler across the stage and measure the field of view diameter at low power:

**How to Measure Field of View:**

```
         ┌─────────────────────────┐
        /                           \
       │    ╔═══════════════════╗    │
       │    ║ ← Ruler markings → ║    │  
       │    ║  │ │ │ │ │ │ │ │  ║    │
       │    ║  0 1 2 3 4 5 mm   ║    │
       │    ╚═══════════════════╝    │
        \                           /
         └─────────────────────────┘
              Field of View
   
   Count the mm markings visible = FOV diameter
```

<!-- lab:data-table rows=4 title="Field of View Diameter" -->
| Objective | Total Magnification | FOV Diameter (mm) | FOV Diameter (μm) | How Measured? |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 4× (Scanning) | 40× | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | Direct measurement |
| 10× (Low power) | 100× | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | Direct measurement |
| 40× (High power) | 400× | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | Calculated |
| 100× (Oil immersion) | 1000× | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | Calculated |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

**Step-by-Step FOV Calculation for High Power:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FORMULA: FOV₂ = FOV₁ × (Magnification₁ ÷ Magnification₂)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

EXAMPLE:
• Low power (100×) FOV measured = 2.0 mm
• High power (400×) FOV = ?

  FOV at 400× = 2.0 mm × (100 ÷ 400)
              = 2.0 mm × 0.25
              = 0.5 mm
              = 500 μm

YOUR CALCULATION:
• Your low power (100×) FOV = _______ mm
• High power (400×) FOV = _______ mm × (100 ÷ 400)
                        = _______ mm × 0.25
                        = _______ mm
                        = _______ μm
```

### Estimating Specimen Size

Once you know the field of view diameter, you can estimate specimen size:

<!-- lab:calculation -->
**Example:**
If the field of view diameter at 100× is 1.5 mm (1500 μm), and a specimen takes up half the field:

Specimen size = 1500 μm × 0.5 = 750 μm

**Convert to different units:**

- 750 μm = 0.75 mm
- 750 μm = 0.00075 m
<!-- /lab:calculation -->

## Part 4: Observing Prepared Slides

> **Learning Goal:** Practice focusing and observing different types of specimens using proper technique.

### Procedure

1. Always start at the LOWEST magnification
2. Use COARSE adjustment to bring specimen into rough focus
3. Use FINE adjustment to sharpen the image
4. When changing to higher magnification:
   - Center the specimen first
   - Rotate to higher objective
   - Use ONLY fine adjustment (never coarse on high power!)
   - Adjust diaphragm for optimal lighting

Specimen chosen: {fill:text}

Field of view diameter at the magnification used: {fill:number} μm

The specimen appears to take up approximately {fill:text} (fraction) of the field of view.

**Calculation:**
Estimated size = FOV diameter × fraction
Estimated size = _____ μm × _____ = _____ μm

Convert to mm: _____ μm ÷ 1000 = _____ mm

## Quick Reference: Units of Measurement

| Unit | Symbol | Relationship | Use |
|------|--------|--------------|-----|
| Meter | m | 1 m = 1,000 mm | Large organisms |
| Millimeter | mm | 1 mm = 1,000 μm | Small organisms, tissues |
| Micrometer | μm | 1 μm = 1,000 nm | Cells |
| Nanometer | nm | 1 nm = 0.001 μm | Molecules, viruses |

**Conversion practice:**

- 50 μm = 50/1000 = 0.05 mm
- 2 mm = 2 × 1000 = 2000 μm
- 0.5 mm = 500 μm

## Formula Summary

| Formula | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Total magnification = Eyepiece × Objective | Calculate how much larger image appears |
| FOV₂ = FOV₁ × (Mag₁/Mag₂) | Calculate field of view at different magnification |
| Specimen size = FOV × fraction | Estimate actual specimen dimensions |

**Connection to Module 04:** Understanding cell structure requires microscopy skills. The techniques you learned today—proper focusing, slide preparation, size estimation—will be essential for observing cell organelles, tissues, and microorganisms throughout this course. Microscopy is also a key diagnostic tool in medicine, from blood smears to tissue biopsies.
