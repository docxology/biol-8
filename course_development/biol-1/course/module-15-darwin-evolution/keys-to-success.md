# Module 15: Darwin and Evolution
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Describe** the key components of Darwin's theory of natural selection.
2.  **Contrast** homologous and analogous structures as evidence for evolution.
3.  **Explain** how fossil and molecular evidence supports common descent.
4.  **Apply** the concept of biological fitness to evolutionary scenarios.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Adaptation**: A heritable trait that increases an organism's fitness in a specific environment.
- [ ] **Biogeography**: The study of the geographic distribution of species.
- [ ] **Transitional Fossil**: A fossil showing intermediate characteristics between ancestral and descendant groups.
- [ ] **Convergent Evolution**: Independent evolution of similar traits in unrelated species due to similar selective pressures.
- [ ] **Industrial Melanism**: The increase in dark-colored (melanic) morphs in polluted environments.

### Concept Check
#### 1. What is Evolution?
*   **Question**: What is the biological definition of evolution?
*   **Key Answer**: Change in allele frequencies in a population over time. Individuals do not evolve; populations evolve over generations.

#### 2. Natural Selection Requirements
*   **Question**: What conditions are required for natural selection?
*   **Key Answer**: (1) Heritable variation, (2) Overproduction of offspring, (3) Differential survival and reproduction based on traits.

#### 3. Evidence: Comparative Anatomy
*   **Question**: What are homologous structures?
*   **Key Answer**: Structures with similar underlying anatomy derived from a common ancestor, despite different functions (e.g., human arm, whale flipper, bat wing).
