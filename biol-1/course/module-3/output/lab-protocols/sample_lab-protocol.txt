Module 3 Lab: Genetic Crosses Simulation

Objective

To simulate genetic crosses and observe inheritance patterns.

Background

This lab uses coin flips to simulate the random nature of genetic inheritance, demonstrating Mendelian principles.

Materials

Two coins (representing alleles)
Lab worksheet
Calculator

Procedure

Part 1: Monohybrid Cross

Assign coin sides: Heads = dominant allele (A), Tails = recessive allele (a)
Flip two coins to represent parental gametes
Record the genotype of the "offspring"
Repeat 20 times
Calculate genotypic and phenotypic ratios

Part 2: Dihybrid Cross

Use two coins for each gene (four coins total)
Flip all four coins simultaneously
Record genotype for both traits
Repeat 20 times
Analyze results

Part 3: Data Analysis

Compare observed ratios to expected Mendelian ratios
Calculate chi-square values
Determine if results match expectations
Discuss sources of variation

Data Tables

Create tables showing:
Individual trial results
Genotypic counts
Phenotypic counts
Expected vs. observed ratios

Questions

How do your results compare to expected ratios?
What factors might cause variation?
Why is a larger sample size better?
How does this relate to real genetic inheritance?

Conclusion

Summarize what you learned about inheritance patterns and probability in genetics.
