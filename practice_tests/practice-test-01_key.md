## Part A: Multiple Choice Answers

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|:---:|:------:|-------------|
| 1 | C | All living things have cellular organization — this is universal to life |
| 2 | A | Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ System → Organism is the correct hierarchy |
| 3 | B | The independent variable is what the scientist deliberately changes |
| 4 | B | A theory is well-supported by extensive, repeated experimental evidence |
| 5 | B | Homeostasis = maintaining internal stability despite external changes |
| 6 | B | Sweating to reduce a fever is negative feedback — opposing the change to restore normal temp |
| 7 | B | Anatomy = structure; Physiology = function |
| 8 | B | The stomach is an organ (composed of multiple tissue types working together) |
| 9 | C | Atomic number = number of protons in the nucleus |
| 10 | B | Covalent bonds involve sharing electrons between atoms |
| 11 | C | Oxygen pulls shared electrons more strongly → unequal sharing → polarity |
| 12 | C | pH 3 is well below 7, making it strongly acidic |
| 13 | A | Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen make up ~96% of living matter |
| 14 | B | Hydrogen bonds give water high specific heat — it resists temperature change |
| 15 | B | Buffers resist pH changes, keeping blood pH stable near 7.35-7.45 |
| 16 | B | Isotopes = same element, different neutron count (e.g., Carbon-12 and Carbon-14) |
| 17 | B | Dehydration synthesis removes water to join monomers into polymers |
| 18 | C | Carbohydrates (glucose) are the body's preferred quick energy source |
| 19 | B | Amino acids are the monomers of proteins (20 different types) |
| 20 | B | The amino acid sequence dictates how the protein folds and what it does |
| 21 | D | DNA and RNA are nucleic acids built from nucleotide monomers |
| 22 | B | Hydrolysis (hydro = water, lysis = break) adds water to split polymers |
| 23 | B | Saturated fats have no C=C double bonds; they pack tightly → solid at room temp |
| 24 | B | Denaturation = loss of 3D shape (and function) due to extreme heat or pH |
| 25 | B | Cell theory: all living things are made of cells; all cells come from pre-existing cells |
| 26 | C | Prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus (pro = before, karyon = nucleus) |
| 27 | C | Mitochondria are the "powerhouse of the cell" — site of aerobic respiration |
| 28 | B | Ribosomes translate mRNA into proteins (protein synthesis) |
| 29 | C | Plant cells have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose; animal cells do not |
| 30 | C | Golgi receives proteins from the ER, modifies, sorts, and ships them in vesicles |
| 31 | C | Ribosomes attached to the ER surface give it the "rough" appearance |
| 32 | B | Endosymbiotic theory: mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent prokaryotes |

## Part C: Short Answer Key

**43. Four characteristics of living things (any four):**

- **Cellular organization:** All living things are made of one or more cells
- **Metabolism:** All organisms carry out chemical reactions to obtain and use energy
- **Homeostasis:** Living things maintain a stable internal environment
- **Reproduction:** Organisms produce offspring (sexually or asexually)
- **Growth and development:** Organisms grow and develop according to genetic instructions
- **Response to stimuli:** Living things detect and respond to changes in their environment
- **Adaptation/Evolution:** Populations change over time through natural selection

**44. Ionic vs. Covalent Bonds:**

- **Ionic bonds:** Electrons are **transferred** from one atom to another, creating oppositely charged ions that attract each other. Example: NaCl (sodium chloride) — sodium gives an electron to chlorine
- **Covalent bonds:** Electrons are **shared** between atoms. Example: H₂O (water) — oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms
- Ionic bonds typically form between metals and nonmetals; covalent bonds form between two nonmetals

**45. Four Biomolecules:**

| Biomolecule | Monomer | Primary Function |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| Carbohydrates | Monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) | Quick energy, structural support |
| Lipids | Fatty acids + glycerol | Long-term energy storage, cell membranes, insulation |
| Proteins | Amino acids | Enzymes, structural support, transport, immune defense |
| Nucleic acids | Nucleotides | Store and transmit genetic information (DNA and RNA) |

---

**46. Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes (any three):**

| Feature | Prokaryotes | Eukaryotes |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Nucleus | No membrane-bound nucleus | Has a true nucleus |
| Organelles | No membrane-bound organelles | Has mitochondria, ER, Golgi, etc. |
| Size | Smaller (typically 1-10 μm) | Larger (typically 10-100 μm) |
| DNA | Single circular chromosome | Multiple linear chromosomes |
| Examples | Bacteria, Archaea | Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists |

**47. Protein pathway from production to export:**

1. **Nucleus:** DNA instructions (a gene) are transcribed into mRNA
2. **Ribosome on Rough ER:** mRNA is translated into a polypeptide chain; the protein enters the ER lumen where initial folding and quality control occur
3. **Golgi Apparatus:** The protein is further modified (e.g., sugar groups added), sorted, and packaged into transport vesicles
4. **Plasma Membrane:** Transport vesicles fuse with the membrane and release the protein outside the cell via exocytosis
