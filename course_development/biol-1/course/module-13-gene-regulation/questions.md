# Module 13: Regulation of Gene Expression
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Prokaryotic Regulation**
    *   Define operon.
    *   Compare inducible operons (lac) vs. repressible operons (trp).

2.  **Eukaryotic Regulation**
    *   Gene expression is controlled at multiple levels. Briefly explain:
        *   Chromatin remodeling (histone modification)
        *   Transcriptional control (transcription factors)
        *   Post-translational control (protein modification/degradation)

3.  **Mutations**
    *   Define point mutation vs. frameshift mutation.
    *   Why are frameshift mutations typically more damaging?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **The Lac Operon**
    *   **Scenario**: E. coli are growing in glucose-only medium.
    *   Is the lac operon on or off? Is the repressor bound?
    *   What happens when lactose is added?

5.  **X-Inactivation**
    *   Explain dosage compensation and Barr body formation.
    *   How does X-inactivation explain calico cat coat patterns?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Cancer and Gene Regulation**
    *   Cancer results from dysregulated gene expression.
    *   Analyze how mutations in tumor suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes lead to uncontrolled cell division.

7.  **Epigenetics**
    *   Environmental factors (diet, stress) can modify DNA methylation without changing the sequence.
    *   Can these modifications be inherited? Discuss evidence.
