# Module 12: Gene Expression (DNA to Protein)
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **DNA Structure**
    *   Describe the double helix. What forms the backbone? What forms the rungs?
    *   Explain antiparallel orientation (5′ to 3′).
    *   State Chargaff's Rules. If a DNA sample is 20% Adenine, what percent is Cytosine?

2.  **The Central Dogma**
    *   Diagram the flow: DNA → RNA → Protein.
    *   Where does transcription occur? Where does translation occur?

3.  **The Machinery**
    *   What is the role of DNA polymerase? RNA polymerase? Ribosomes?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Replication**
    *   DNA replication is semi-conservative. Explain what this means.
    *   Why is there a leading strand (continuous synthesis) and a lagging strand (Okazaki fragments)?

5.  **Translation Practice**
    *   DNA template strand: 3′-TAC GGG AAA ACT-5′.
    *   Transcribe to mRNA (5′→3′).
    *   Translate to amino acids using a codon chart.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **RNA Processing**
    *   Explain the purpose of:
        *   Introns vs. Exons
        *   5′ Cap and Poly-A Tail
    *   Why might alternative splicing be advantageous?

7.  **Universal Code**
    *   The genetic code is nearly universal. How does this support common ancestry? How does it enable biotechnology (e.g., producing human insulin in bacteria)?
