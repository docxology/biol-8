<li>
<p>What is the main purpose of meiosis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What type of cells are produced by meiosis, and what are they called?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it necessary for gametes to be haploid rather than diploid?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would happen to the chromosome number in offspring if gametes were diploid?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does meiosis contribute to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the main differences between mitosis and meiosis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many cell divisions occur in meiosis, and how does this compare to mitosis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does meiosis result in four cells while mitosis results in two?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the stages of meiosis I, and what happens during each?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the key event that distinguishes meiosis I from meiosis II?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During which phase of meiosis do homologous chromosomes pair up?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a tetrad, and when is it formed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes separate. What separates during meiosis II?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is crossing over, and when does it occur?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does crossing over increase genetic variation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is independent assortment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does random fertilization add to the genetic variation produced by meiosis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is nondisjunction, and when can it occur?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is trisomy? Give an example of a condition caused by trisomy.</p>
