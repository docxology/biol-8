# Module 8: Cellular Respiration
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Map** the stages of cellular respiration to their locations in the cell.
2.  **Calculate** the inputs and outputs (ATP, NADH, FADH₂) for each stage.
3.  **Explain** the function of the Electron Transport Chain and chemiosmosis.
4.  **Compare** aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, and fermentation.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Aerobic vs. Anaerobic**: Requiring oxygen vs. not requiring oxygen.
- [ ] **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons (glucose is oxidized during respiration).
- [ ] **Reduction**: Gain of electrons (oxygen is reduced to water).
- [ ] **Chemiosmosis**: ATP synthesis driven by the flow of H⁺ ions down their electrochemical gradient through ATP synthase.
- [ ] **ATP Synthase**: The enzyme complex that synthesizes ATP from ADP and Pᵢ.
- [ ] **Cristae**: Inner mitochondrial membrane folds that increase surface area for the ETC.

### Concept Check
#### 1. The Electron Transport Chain
*   **Question**: What is the role of the ETC?
*   **Key Answer**: The ETC transfers electrons through protein complexes, using the released energy to pump H⁺ ions across the inner membrane. The resulting proton gradient drives ATP synthesis via ATP synthase (oxidative phosphorylation).

#### 2. Oxygen's Role
*   **Question**: Why is oxygen essential for aerobic respiration?
*   **Key Answer**: Oxygen is the final electron acceptor in the ETC. Without it, electrons cannot flow, the proton gradient collapses, and ATP production ceases. Oxygen is reduced to water.

#### 3. Fermentation
*   **Question**: Why do cells perform fermentation?
*   **Key Answer**: Fermentation regenerates NAD⁺ from NADH, allowing glycolysis to continue producing 2 ATP per glucose in the absence of oxygen. The carbon in pyruvate is converted to ethanol (yeast) or lactate (muscle) rather than fully oxidized.
