# Repository Rules

## Real Methods Policy

**Always use real methods and implementations - no mocks, stubs, or fake methods.**

### Code Standards
- All functions use real library implementations
- All file operations use real file system operations
- All validation uses real validation logic
- All API integrations use real API clients with proper error handling

### Testing Standards
- Tests use real file operations and real library calls
- No mocks or stubs in test code
- External API tests validate structure/logic, not actual API calls
- Integration tests that require external services are clearly marked

### Documentation
- All documentation emphasizes real implementations
- Function signatures document real method calls
- Examples use real code, not mocked examples
