# Module 01: Exploring Life Science — Keys to Success

## Key Learning Objectives

### 1. Define and Describe Life
- Define what constitutes a living organism
- Identify the characteristics shared by all living things (organization, metabolism, homeostasis, growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, adaptation)
- Distinguish between living and non-living matter

### 2. Understand the Scientific Method
- Describe the steps of the scientific method
- Differentiate between hypothesis, theory, and scientific law
- Design simple experiments with appropriate controls and variables
- Analyze and interpret experimental data

### 3. Levels of Biological Organization
- Identify and order the hierarchical levels of life (atom → molecule → organelle → cell → tissue → organ → organ system → organism → population → community → ecosystem → biosphere)
- Explain the relationship between structure and function at each level

### 4. Basic Principles of Evolution
- Define evolution and natural selection
- Explain how adaptations arise in populations
- Understand why biodiversity is important for ecosystem health

### 5. Core Themes in Biology
- Recognize the interconnection between organisms and their environment
- Appreciate the unity and diversity of life
- Understand energy flow and matter cycling in biological systems

## Study Tips

1. **Create a visual hierarchy** of the levels of organization with examples at each level
2. **Practice designing experiments** with clear hypotheses, variables, and controls
3. **Connect concepts** to everyday observations in nature
4. **Use flashcards** for key terminology and definitions
