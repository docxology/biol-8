# Module 10: Inheritance — Keys to Success

## Key Learning Objectives

### 1. Mendelian Genetics Foundations

- Define gene, allele, genotype, and phenotype
- Distinguish between dominant and recessive alleles
- Explain homozygous and heterozygous conditions
- Describe Mendel's experiments and his laws of heredity

### 2. Law of Segregation

- Explain the law of segregation
- Use Punnett squares to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes
- Calculate genotypic and phenotypic ratios for monohybrid crosses

### 3. Law of Independent Assortment

- Explain the law of independent assortment
- Understand how pairs of alleles segregate independently of one another during gamete formation
- Perform dihybrid crosses using Punnett squares

### 4. Extensions to Mendelian Genetics

- Describe incomplete dominance and codominance
- Explain multiple alleles using ABO blood types as an example
- Understand polygenic inheritance and continuous variation
- Explain pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits)

### 5. Sex Linkage and Chromosomal Inheritance

- Describe sex determination in humans
- Explain sex-linked inheritance patterns
- Predict outcomes of crosses involving X-linked traits
- Understand why sex-linked disorders are more common in males

### 6. Pedigree Analysis

- Interpret pedigree charts
- Determine modes of inheritance from pedigrees
- Identify carriers and affected individuals

## Study Tips

1. **Practice Punnett squares** extensively until you are comfortable setting up the axes correctly.
2. **Learn genetics vocabulary** thoroughly; knowing the exact difference between a gene and an allele is critical.
3. **Analyze pedigree examples** from different inheritance patterns.
4. **Calculate ratios** for various cross types and try predicting outcomes before doing the math.
5. **Connect concepts** to real genetic conditions like color blindness or hemophilia.
