<h2>Student Support Services</h2>
<p>Good information and clear communication about your needs will help you be successful. Please let your instructor know about any specific challenges or technology limitations that might affect your participation in class. College of the Redwoods wants every student to be successful.</p>
<h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>In the academic community, the high value placed on truth implies a corresponding intolerance of scholastic dishonesty. In cases involving academic dishonesty, determination of the grade and of the student's status in the course is left primarily to the discretion of the faculty member. In such cases, where the instructor determines that a student has demonstrated academic dishonesty, the student may receive a failing grade for the assignment and/or exam and may be reported to the Chief Student Services Officer or designee.</p>
<h2>Respect and Disruptive Behavior</h2>
<p>We expect a respectful and inclusive learning environment. Student behavior or speech that disrupts the instructional setting will not be tolerated. Disruptive conduct may include, but is not limited to: unwarranted interruptions; failure to adhere to instructor's directions; vulgar or obscene language; slurs or other forms of intimidation; and physically or verbally abusive behavior. The student may be reported to the Chief Student Services Officer or designee. Additional information about the rights and responsibilities of students, Board policies, and administrative procedures is located in the 2023-2024 College Catalog and CR Board and Administrative Policies.</p>
