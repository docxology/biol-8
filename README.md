# Biology at College of the Redwoods (Del Norte, CA)

This is a private repository for Biology courses at College of the Redwoods (Del Norte, CA), organized by Dr. Daniel Ari Friedman ([@docxology](https://github.com/docxology) on GitHub).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main areas:

1. **`course_development/`**: The "Back Office" for private curriculum development.
2. **`PUBLISHED/`**: Public, ready-to-upload course materials.
3. **`software/`**: Automation tools and documentation.

## 🏗️ Course Development (`course_development/`)

This is the working directory for instructors. It contains the source of truth for all course content.

### Courses

- **[BIOL-1](course_development/biol-1/)**: Biology 1 at Pelican Bay Prison
- **[BIOL-8](course_development/biol-8/)**: Biology 8 at College of the Redwoods

### Structure

Each course folder contains:

- **`course/`**: Working modules with source Markdown files
- **`syllabus/`**: Syllabus source files
- **`private/`**: Instructor-only materials (Tests, Accommodations)
- **`resources/`**: References, Templates, Media

---

## 📤 Published Outputs (`PUBLISHED/`)

Final rendered materials for public distribution. **Each course is a separate public GitHub repository:**

| Course | Public Repository | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| BIOL-1 | [github.com/docxology/biol-1](https://github.com/docxology/biol-1) | General Biology - Pelican Bay Prison |
| BIOL-8 | [github.com/docxology/biol-8](https://github.com/docxology/biol-8) | Human Anatomy & Physiology - CR Del Norte |

### Architecture

- `PUBLISHED/` is **excluded from cr-bio** (via `.gitignore`)
- Each subfolder (`biol-1/`, `biol-8/`) is an independent git repo
- Use `software/scripts/publish_all.py` to generate and validate outputs
- Use `git push` within each subfolder to update the public repos

**Note**: Do not edit files here directly. Edit source in `course_development/` and regenerate.

---

## 🛠️ Software Utilities (`software/`)

The automation engine for the repository.

- **`src/`**: Python modules (markdown_to_pdf, text_to_speech, etc.)
- **`scripts/`**: CLI tools (generate_all_outputs.py, publish_course.py)
- **`docs/`**: [Documentation](software/docs/README.md) for the software system

### Key Scripts

```bash
# Generate outputs for a course
uv run python software/scripts/generate_all_outputs.py --course biol-8

# Publish generated outputs to PUBLISHED/
uv run python software/scripts/publish_course.py --course all
```

See [software/docs/README.md](software/docs/README.md) for comprehensive documentation.
