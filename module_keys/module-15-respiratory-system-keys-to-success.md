# Module 15: Respiratory System — Keys to Success

## Key Learning Objectives

### 1. Respiratory System Overview
- Describe the primary functions of the respiratory system
- Distinguish between external and internal respiration
- Explain the relationship between the respiratory and cardiovascular systems
- Understand the role of respiration in pH balance

### 2. Anatomy of the Respiratory System
- Identify the structures of the upper respiratory tract (nose, pharynx, larynx)
- Identify the structures of the lower respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli)
- Describe the structure and function of the alveoli
- Explain the role of surfactant in lung function

### 3. Mechanics of Breathing
- Describe the process of inspiration and expiration
- Explain the role of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles
- Understand how pressure changes drive breathing
- Define respiratory volumes and capacities

### 4. Gas Exchange
- Explain how gases are exchanged in the alveoli
- Describe the factors that affect gas exchange
- Understand the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide
- Explain the relationship between alveolar structure and gas exchange efficiency

### 5. Gas Transport in Blood
- Describe how oxygen is transported in the blood
- Explain the role of hemoglobin in oxygen transport
- Describe how carbon dioxide is transported in the blood
- Understand the relationship between oxygen-hemoglobin saturation and tissue needs

### 6. Control of Breathing
- Explain how the brain controls breathing rate
- Describe the role of chemoreceptors in regulating respiration
- Understand how CO₂ and O₂ levels affect breathing
- Describe common respiratory disorders
