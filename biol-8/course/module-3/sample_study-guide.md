# Module 3 Study Guide: Climate Change

## Key Terms

- **Climate Change**: Long-term climate pattern changes
- **Global Warming**: Increase in Earth's temperature
- **Greenhouse Effect**: Heat trapping by gases
- **Greenhouse Gases**: Gases that trap heat
- **Carbon Dioxide**: Major greenhouse gas
- **Ocean Acidification**: Decrease in ocean pH
- **Mitigation**: Reducing climate change causes
- **Adaptation**: Adjusting to climate impacts
- **Phenology**: Timing of biological events
- **Sea Level Rise**: Increase in ocean levels

## Greenhouse Effect

- Natural process essential for life
- Enhanced by human activities
- Major gases: CO2, CH4, N2O
- Leads to global warming

## Evidence

- Rising temperatures
- Melting ice
- Sea level rise
- Extreme weather
- Ecosystem changes

## Ecosystem Impacts

### Terrestrial
- Species range shifts
- Phenology changes

### Marine
- Ocean acidification
- Coral bleaching
- Distribution changes

### Freshwater
- Flow alterations
- Temperature increases
- Species composition changes

## Responses

### Mitigation
- Reduce emissions
- Renewable energy
- Energy efficiency
- Carbon capture

### Adaptation
- Protect ecosystems
- Restore habitats
- Assist migration
- Resilient practices
