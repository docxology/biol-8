# Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Defining Evolution**
    *   If a population's allele frequencies change from 50% A / 50% a to 90% A / 10% a, has evolution occurred?

2.  **Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium**
    *   What does the Hardy-Weinberg principle describe?
    *   List the five conditions required for equilibrium. Are these conditions common in nature?

3.  **Genetic Drift**
    *   Define genetic drift. Does it affect large or small populations more strongly?
    *   Distinguish the Bottleneck Effect from the Founder Effect.

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Types of Selection**
    *   Sketch graphs representing:
        *   Directional selection
        *   Stabilizing selection
        *   Disruptive selection
    *   Provide a real-world example of each.

5.  **Heterozygote Advantage**
    *   Sickle cell disease is recessive and often lethal. Why is the allele common in malaria-endemic regions?
    *   How does this demonstrate that fitness is environment-dependent?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Sexual Selection**
    *   Peacocks have elaborate tails that increase predation risk. How can natural selection permit this trait?

7.  **Gene Flow**
    *   Two deer populations are separated by a mountain. A tunnel allows interbreeding.
    *   Will the populations become more similar or more different? What is the effect on speciation potential?
