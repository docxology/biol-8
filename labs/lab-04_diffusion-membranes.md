## Introduction

Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. This passive process requires no energy input and is fundamental to life—it's how oxygen enters cells, how carbon dioxide leaves, how nutrients are absorbed, and how wastes are removed.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Diffusion**: Net movement of molecules from high to low concentration
- **Osmosis**: Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane
- **Selectively Permeable Membrane**: A membrane that allows some substances to pass while blocking others
- **Concentration Gradient**: The difference in concentration between two areas

**Factors Affecting Diffusion Rate:**

1. **Temperature** — Higher temperature = faster diffusion (molecules have more kinetic energy)
2. **Molecular Size** — Smaller molecules = faster diffusion
3. **Concentration Gradient** — Steeper gradient = faster diffusion
4. **Medium** — Diffusion is faster in gases than liquids, faster in liquids than solids

## Part 1: Molecular Size and Diffusion Rate (Agar Plate)

> **Learning Goal:** Compare how molecules of different sizes diffuse through a semi-solid medium.

### Background

Smaller molecules move faster and diffuse more quickly than larger molecules. In this experiment, you'll observe how two different dyes with different molecular weights diffuse outward from a central well in an agar plate.

**Dyes Used in This Experiment:**

| Dye | Approximate Molecular Weight (g/mol) | Color |
|-----|-------------------------------------|-------|
| Potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) | 158 | Purple |
| Methylene blue | 320 | Blue |

> **Note:** Methylene blue is approximately **twice** the molecular weight of potassium permanganate!

### Materials Checklist

<!-- /lab:checklist -->

### Procedure

1. Obtain an agar plate with a central well
2. Carefully add a small drop of **potassium permanganate** (purple) to the well
3. Carefully add a small drop of **methylene blue** (blue) to the well

## Part 2: Temperature and Diffusion in Water

> **Learning Goal:** Investigate how temperature affects the rate of diffusion and observe density-driven flow patterns.

### Background

At higher temperatures, molecules have more kinetic energy and move faster, resulting in faster diffusion. Additionally, temperature affects water density—hot water is less dense and rises, while cold water is denser and sinks. This experiment demonstrates both concepts.

### Materials Checklist

<!-- lab:checklist -->
Before beginning Part 2, confirm you have the following materials:

- [ ] Heating plate

- [ ] Red dye
- [ ] Blue dye
- [ ] Plastic frame with removable vertical divider
- [ ] White background paper or mat
- [ ] Stirring rod
- [ ] Thermometer (optional)
<!-- /lab:checklist -->

### Part 2A: Temperature Effect on Diffusion

## Part 3: Osmosis and Dialysis Tubing

> **Learning Goal:** Demonstrate osmosis using dialysis tubing and demonstrate selective permeability.

### Background

**Dialysis tubing** is a selectively permeable membrane that allows water and small molecules (like iodine) to pass through but blocks larger molecules (like sucrose and starch). This makes it an excellent model for studying osmosis and selective permeability.

**Key Terms:**

- **Hypertonic solution**: Higher solute concentration (water moves OUT)
- **Hypotonic solution**: Lower solute concentration (water moves IN)
- **Isotonic solution**: Equal solute concentration (no net water movement)

### Materials Checklist

<!-- lab:checklist -->
Before beginning Part 3, confirm you have the following materials:

- [ ] 6 pieces of dialysis tubing
- [ ] String and plastic clips for sealing tubing
- [ ] Large bowl for the bath
- [ ] 1% sucrose solution
- [ ] 10% sucrose solution
- [ ] 20% sucrose solution
- [ ] Starch solution
- [ ] Iodine solution
- [ ] Paper towels
- [ ] Timer
<!-- /lab:checklist -->

### Preparing Dialysis Tubing

**Critical Instructions:**

1. Each group will prepare **6 dialysis tubes** total
2. **Soak each piece of tubing** in water before use (makes it easier to open and seal)
3. **Seal one end** of each tube by:
   - Carefully folding the end over
   - Tying the folded portion **securely with string**
4. After filling, seal the top with a **plastic clip** (for hanging)

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Your tubing must be **tightly sealed** to prevent leaks! Test for leaks before placing in the bath.

### Part 3A: Sucrose Concentration and Osmosis

**Setup:**

1. Fill the main bowl with **1% sucrose solution** (this is the "bath")
2. Prepare **3 dialysis bags** containing:
   - Bag A: **1% sucrose solution** (isotonic to bath)
   - Bag B: **10% sucrose solution** (hypertonic to bath)
   - Bag C: **20% sucrose solution** (hypertonic to bath)
3. Seal all bags securely and **blot dry** with paper towel
4. **Weigh each bag** and record initial mass
5. Place all bags in the 1% sucrose bath
6. Wait **30 minutes** (or as directed)
7. Remove bags, blot dry, and record final mass

### Hypothesis — Part 3A

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Predict what will happen to each bag. Will it gain mass, lose mass, or stay the same? Explain your reasoning:**

| Bag | Contents | Prediction | Reasoning |
|-----|----------|------------|-----------|
| A | 1% sucrose | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
| B | 10% sucrose | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
| C | 20% sucrose | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Data Collection — Part 3A

<!-- lab:data-table rows=3 title="Dialysis Tubing Osmosis Data" -->
| Bag | Contents (% Sucrose) | Initial Mass (g) | Final Mass (g) | Change in Mass (g) | % Change |
|-----|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| A | 1% (isotonic) | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | {fill:number} |
| B | 10% | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | {fill:number} |
| C | 20% | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | {fill:number} | {fill:number} |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

**Calculate % Change:**

```
% Change = [(Final Mass - Initial Mass) / Initial Mass] × 100

Example: Initial = 10.0 g, Final = 12.5 g
% Change = [(12.5 - 10.0) / 10.0] × 100 = +25%
```

**2. Explain your results in terms of osmosis. Which direction did water move for each bag and why?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**3. For each bag, classify the INSIDE relative to the OUTSIDE (1% sucrose bath):**

|-----|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| A (1%) | 1% sucrose | {fill:text} |
| B (10%) | 10% sucrose | {fill:text} |
| C (20%) | 20% sucrose | {fill:text} |

### Part 3B: Selective Permeability — Starch and Iodine Test

**Background:**

This experiment demonstrates that dialysis tubing is **selectively permeable**:

- **Iodine** molecules are small enough to pass through the membrane
- **Starch** molecules are too large to pass through

When iodine contacts starch, it turns **blue-black** (positive starch test).

**Setup:**

1. Prepare a dialysis bag containing **starch solution**
2. Seal the bag securely
3. Fill a beaker with water and add **iodine solution** (the bath will turn amber/brown)
4. Place the starch-filled dialysis bag in the iodine bath
5. Wait **15-20 minutes** and observe both the bag and the bath

### Hypothesis — Part 3B

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Predict what color changes you will observe. Explain your reasoning based on molecular size:**

**Connection to Module 04:** Understanding diffusion and osmosis is essential for understanding how cells function. These passive transport processes explain how oxygen enters your blood, how nutrients are absorbed in your intestines, how your kidneys filter waste, and why drinking seawater dehydrates you. Membrane transport is fundamental to life!
