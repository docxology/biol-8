## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Define histology** and explain the relationship between cells, tissues, and organs
- **Identify the four primary tissue types** under a microscope
- **Classify epithelial tissues** based on cell shape and layer number
- **Distinguish connective tissue types** by their matrix and fiber types
- **Compare the structure and function** of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle
- **Identify neurons** and glial cells in nervous tissue

## Introduction

**Histology** is the microscopic study of **tissues**—groups of similar cells working together to perform a specific function. The human body is built from four primary tissue types:

1. **Epithelial**: Covers surfaces, lines cavities, forms glands
2. **Connective**: Supports, protects, binds other tissues together
3. **Muscle**: Specialized for contraction (movement)
4. **Nervous**: Specialized for communication (electrical signals)

In this lab, you will examine prepared microscope slides of these tissues to understand how their **structure** (form) relates to their **function** (physiology).

## Part 1: Epithelial Tissue

> **Key Characteristic:** Highly cellular, very little extracellular matrix, always has a free (apical) surface and a basement membrane.

Epithelial tissues are classified by **number of layers** and **cell shape**.

| Layers | Shape |
|---|---|
| **Simple** (one layer) | **Squamous** (flat) |
| **Stratified** (multi-layer) | **Cuboidal** (cube-like) |
| | **Columnar** (tall/narrow) |

### Observation 1: Simple Squamous Epithelium

- **Slide:** Lung (alveoli) or Kidney (glomerulus)
- **Look for:** Single layer of very flat cells; looks like a tiled floor from above or a thin line from the side.
- **Function:** Rapid diffusion and filtration.

### Observation 2: Stratified Squamous Epithelium

- **Slide:** Skin (keratinized) or Esophagus (non-keratinized)
- **Look for:** Many layers of cells. Cells near the bottom are cuboidal; cells at the top are flat (squamous).
- **Function:** Protection against abrasion.

## Part 2: Connective Tissue

> **Key Characteristic:** Sparse cells scattered in an abundant **extracellular matrix** (fibers + ground substance).

The properties of connective tissue depend largely on the **matrix**.

### Observation 3: Adipose Tissue (Fat)

- **Slide:** Adipose
- **Look for:** Large, empty-looking cells (signet ring shape). The nucleus is pushed to the very edge.
- **Function:** Energy storage, insulation, cushioning.

### Observation 4: Hyaline Cartilage

- **Slide:** Trachea or Rib
- **Look for:** Cells (**chondrocytes**) sitting in small cavities called **lacunae**. The matrix is smooth/glassy (purple/blue).
- **Function:** Support and reinforcement.

### Observation 5: Bone (Osseous Tissue)

- **Slide:** Ground bone
- **Look for:** Tree-ring pattern. Each unit is an **osteon** with a central canal. Cells (**osteocytes**) are in lacunae connected by tiny canals (**canaliculi**).
- **Function:** Support, protection, calcium storage.

### Observation 6: Blood

- **Slide:** Human blood smear
- **Look for:** Many molecules!
  - **Red blood cells (RBCs):** Small, round, pink, no nucleus.
  - **White blood cells (WBCs):** Larger, purple-stained nucleus.
  - **Platelets:** Tiny purple fragments.
  - **Matrix:** Plasma (fluid, not visible).
- **Function:** Transport of gases, nutrients, wastes.

## Part 3: Muscle Tissue

> **Key Characteristic:** Specialized for contraction.

### Observation 7: Skeletal Muscle

- **Slide:** Skeletal muscle (longitudinal)
- **Look for:** Long, cylindrical cells (fibers). **Multinucleate** (nuclei at edges). Obvious **striations** (stripes).
- **Control:** Voluntary.

### Observation 8: Cardiac Muscle

- **Slide:** Cardiac muscle
- **Look for:** Branched cells. Usually one nucleus. Faint striations. **Intercalated discs** (dark perpendicular lines joining cells).
- **Control:** Involuntary.

### Observation 9: Smooth Muscle

- **Slide:** Intestine or Uterus
- **Look for:** Spindle-shaped cells (tapered ends). One central nucleus. **No striations**. Cells pack closely to form sheets.
- **Control:** Involuntary.

### Comparison Table

<!-- lab:data-table rows=4 title="Muscle Tissue Comparison" -->
| Type | Striations? (Yes/No) | # of Nuclei | Voluntary? (Yes/No) | Location Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Skeletal** | {fill:text} | Many | {fill:text} | Attached to bones |
| **Cardiac** | {fill:text} | One | {fill:text} | Heart only |
| **Smooth** | {fill:text} | One | {fill:text} | Walls of hollow organs |

## Part 4: Nervous Tissue

> **Key Characteristic:** Conductivity.

### Observation 10: Multipolar Neuron

- **Slide:** Motor nerve smear (ox spinal cord)
- **Look for:** Large, star-shaped cells (**neurons**).
  - **Cell body (soma):** Contains the nucleus.
  - **Processes:** Axons and dendrites extending out.
  - **Glial cells:** Tiny dark dots surrounding the neurons (support cells).

## Conclusion & Analysis

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. How does the structure of simple squamous epithelium fits its function in the lungs?**
{fill:textarea rows=2}

**2. Why is bone tissue hard and rigid, while blood is fluid, even though both are "connective tissues"? What component makes the difference?**
{fill:textarea rows=2}

**3. If you were looking at a muscle slide and saw striations and branching cells with intercalated discs, which muscle type would it be?**
{fill:text}

**4. What is the difference between a neuron and a glial cell?**
{fill:textarea rows=2}

**5. A patient has a condition where their stratified squamous epithelium is replaced by simple columnar epithelium in the esophagus (Barrett's Esophagus). Why might this be a problem given the function of the esophagus?**
