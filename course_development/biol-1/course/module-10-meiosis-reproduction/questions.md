# Module 10: Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Sexual Reproduction Basics**
    *   Define gametes and zygotes.
    *   Why must gametes be haploid (n) while somatic cells are diploid (2n)?

2.  **Meiosis Phases**
    *   What is separated in Anaphase I? (Homologous pairs)
    *   What is separated in Anaphase II? (Sister chromatids)

3.  **Sources of Variation**
    *   Describe crossing over (recombination). When does it occur?
    *   Describe independent assortment. How does random alignment create unique gametes?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Mitosis vs. Meiosis**
    *   Create a comparison table:
        *   **End Product**: 2 diploid identical cells vs. 4 haploid unique cells.
        *   **Purpose**: Growth/repair vs. reproduction.
        *   **Divisions**: 1 vs. 2.

5.  **Human Genetics**
    *   How many pairs of autosomes do humans have? How many pairs of sex chromosomes?
    *   What determines biological sex in humans?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Nondisjunction Disorders**
    *   Define nondisjunction.
    *   If nondisjunction occurs in Meiosis I, how many abnormal gametes result? What if it occurs in Meiosis II?
    *   Explain the cause of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21).

7.  **The Cost of Sex**
    *   Asexual reproduction is efficient; sexual reproduction is costly. Evaluate why sexual reproduction remains prevalent despite this cost. (Genetic diversity)
