# Module 11: Mendelian Genetics
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Predict** the outcomes of monohybrid and dihybrid crosses using Punnett Squares.
2.  **Differentiate** between dominant, recessive, incomplete dominance, and codominance.
3.  **Analyze** pedigrees to determine inheritance patterns (autosomal vs. sex-linked).
4.  **Explain** how multiple alleles and polygenic inheritance produce phenotypic variation.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Locus**: The specific position of a gene on a chromosome.
- [ ] **True-Breeding**: An organism homozygous for a trait that always produces offspring with the same phenotype.
- [ ] **F₁ Generation**: The first filial generation (offspring of P₀ cross).
- [ ] **Carrier**: A heterozygous individual who possesses a recessive allele but does not express the trait.
- [ ] **Pleiotropy**: A single gene affecting multiple phenotypic traits.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Monohybrid Ratios
*   **Question**: What phenotypic ratio results from a monohybrid cross between two heterozygotes?
*   **Key Answer**: 3:1 (3 dominant phenotype : 1 recessive phenotype). Genotypic ratio is 1:2:1 (1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa).

#### 2. Dihybrid Ratios
*   **Question**: What phenotypic ratio results from a dihybrid cross (AaBb × AaBb)?
*   **Key Answer**: 9:3:3:1 (9 A_B_ : 3 A_bb : 3 aaB_ : 1 aabb).

#### 3. Sex-Linked Inheritance
*   **Question**: Why are males more frequently affected by sex-linked recessive disorders?
*   **Key Answer**: Males are hemizygous (XY)—they have only one X chromosome. A single recessive allele on the X will be expressed. Females (XX) require two copies for expression.
