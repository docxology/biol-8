## Introduction

### Why This Lab Matters

In biology, understanding the physical and chemical properties of liquids is essential. Every living organism exists in a liquid environment — cells are bathed in interstitial fluid, blood carries dissolved gases and nutrients, and even the simplest microbe is sensitive to the pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen of its surroundings. Clinicians measure these same properties daily: blood pH, electrolyte conductivity, dissolved oxygen saturation, and urine turbidity are all standard diagnostic tests.

Before you can work with living organisms in future labs, you need to **master the measurement tools** and develop **good lab hygiene habits**. Proper probe handling — rinsing between samples, calibrating before use, avoiding cross-contamination — is the same discipline required for aseptic technique when working with cultures, tissue samples, and body fluids. The habits you build today with tap water and lemon juice are the exact habits that protect both you and your specimens later.

### What You Will Measure

In this lab you will use **six different Vernier probes** connected to a **LabQuest Mini** to characterize two liquids: **Pure Tap Water** and **Lemon Juice**. Here is a preview of every measurement you will make:

| # | Probe (Device) | What It Measures | Units | Key Question |
|---|---------------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **pH Meter** (+ Dip pH) | Hydrogen ion concentration | pH (0–14) | How acidic or basic is the liquid? |
| 2 | **Conductivity Probe** | Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) | µS/cm | How many dissolved ions are present? |
| 3 | **Temperature Probe** (+ analog thermometer) | Temperature | °C | Are the liquids at the same temperature? |
| 4 | **Dissolved Oxygen Probe** | Dissolved Oxygen (DO) | mg/L | How much O₂ is available in the liquid? |
| 5 | **Colorimeter** | Absorbance at 430, 470, 565, 635 nm | Abs | Which wavelengths of light does the liquid absorb? |
| 6 | **Turbidity Probe** | Transmittance level | NTU / %T | How cloudy is the liquid? |

Each probe reveals a different dimension of the liquid's character. Together, these six measurements build a comprehensive profile — the same approach used in clinical labs, water treatment facilities, and environmental field stations.

### Predictions — Two Test Liquids

### How the Lab Works

Each group has a **LabQuest Mini** connected to a laptop via USB. We have a limited number of some probes, so they are **shared between groups**. Work through whichever probe is available at your station — there is no required order. Rotate through all six measurement stations until your data table is complete. The only rule: **always rinse the probe with distilled water and blot dry between samples** to avoid cross-contamination (precisely the same discipline you will use when handling biological specimens).

## Part 1: pH Meter

> **Learning Goal:** Measure pH using both the standard pH probe and the Dip pH sensor. Understand the pH scale and what hydrogen ion concentration tells us about a solution.

### What Is pH?

pH measures the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution. The scale runs from 0 (strongly acidic) to 14 (strongly basic), with 7 being neutral. Each whole number step represents a **10-fold** change in H⁺ concentration.

**Common pH examples:** battery acid (0.5), lemon juice (~2), vinegar (2.4), coffee (5), milk (6.5), pure water (7), baking soda (8.3), seawater (8), ammonia (11.5), drain cleaner (14).

### Procedure

1. Connect the **pH probe** to the LabQuest Mini
2. Calibrate if instructed (Logger Pro may auto-calibrate)
3. Rinse the probe tip with distilled water and blot dry
4. Submerge the probe tip in the **Tap Water** sample — wait for the reading to stabilize
5. Record the pH value
6. Rinse the probe, blot dry, then submerge in the **Lemon Juice** sample
7. Record the pH value
8. If a **Dip pH** sensor is available, repeat the measurements and record those readings as well

## Part 2: Conductivity Probe (Total Dissolved Solids)

> **Learning Goal:** Measure the electrical conductivity of each liquid and understand how dissolved ions affect a solution's ability to conduct electricity.

### What Is Conductivity?

**Conductivity** measures how well a solution conducts electricity. Pure water is a poor conductor, but dissolved ions (salts, acids, minerals) allow current to flow. Conductivity is measured in **microsiemens per centimeter (µS/cm)** and is directly related to **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)**.

### Procedure

1. Connect the **Conductivity probe** to the LabQuest Mini
2. Rinse the probe with distilled water
3. Submerge in **Tap Water** — wait for a stable reading
4. Record the value
5. Rinse, then submerge in **Lemon Juice**
6. Record the value

### Prediction

## Part 3: Temperature Probe

> **Learning Goal:** Measure temperature using both a digital temperature probe and an analog thermometer. Compare the precision and convenience of each method.

### Procedure

1. Connect the **Temperature probe** to the LabQuest Mini
2. Place the digital probe in the **Tap Water** — wait for it to stabilize
3. Record the temperature in °C
4. Also measure the same sample with the **analog thermometer** and record
5. Repeat both measurements for the **Lemon Juice**

### Prediction

## Part 4: Dissolved Oxygen Probe

> **Learning Goal:** Measure dissolved oxygen (DO) in each liquid and understand why oxygen levels in water matter for living organisms.

### What Is Dissolved Oxygen?

**Dissolved oxygen (DO)** is the amount of oxygen gas (O₂) dissolved in a liquid, measured in **mg/L** (milligrams per liter). Aquatic organisms depend on DO for respiration. Factors affecting DO include temperature, salinity, and organic matter.

### Procedure

1. Connect the **Dissolved Oxygen probe** to the LabQuest Mini
2. Allow the probe to warm up (the membrane tip needs time to equilibrate)
3. Gently stir the probe in the **Tap Water** to ensure fresh water contacts the membrane
4. Record the DO reading once stable
5. Rinse, then measure the **Lemon Juice**
6. Record the DO reading

### Prediction

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Which liquid do you predict will have more dissolved oxygen? Why?**

| Lemon Juice | {fill:number} |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Analysis

## Part 5: Colorimeter (Absorbance)

> **Learning Goal:** Measure how much light each liquid absorbs at four different wavelengths, and understand what absorbance tells us about a liquid's composition.

### What Is Absorbance?

A **colorimeter** sends a beam of light at a specific wavelength through a sample and measures how much light is absorbed. Clear solutions absorb very little light; colored or turbid solutions absorb more. Absorbance is measured in **Absorbance units (Abs)** — higher values mean more light is absorbed.

**Available wavelengths on the Vernier Colorimeter:** 430 nm (violet), 470 nm (blue), 565 nm (green), 635 nm (red)

### Procedure

1. Connect the **Colorimeter** to the LabQuest Mini
2. Insert a cuvette of **distilled water** and calibrate (set as blank/zero) at each wavelength
3. Fill a cuvette with **Tap Water**, insert, and record absorbance at all four wavelengths
4. Fill a clean cuvette with **Lemon Juice**, insert, and record absorbance at all four wavelengths

### Prediction

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Which liquid do you expect to absorb more light? At which wavelength(s) do you expect the biggest difference?**

### Data Collection

## Part 6: Turbidity Probe (Transmittance)

> **Learning Goal:** Measure the turbidity (cloudiness) of each liquid and understand how suspended particles affect light transmittance.

### What Is Turbidity?

**Turbidity** measures how cloudy or opaque a liquid is, based on how much light can pass through it. It is typically reported in **NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units)** or as **percent transmittance (%T)**. Higher turbidity means more suspended particles scattering light.

### Procedure

1. Connect the **Turbidity probe** to the LabQuest Mini
2. Calibrate with distilled water if instructed
3. Insert the **Tap Water** sample and record the reading
4. Insert the **Lemon Juice** sample and record the reading

### Prediction

**Connection to Module 05:** Understanding how to measure and characterize liquids is fundamental to biology. Body fluids—blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid—are all assessed by these same types of measurements (pH, electrolyte conductivity, dissolved gases). The techniques you practiced here with LabQuest Mini are directly analogous to those used in clinical laboratories and environmental monitoring.
