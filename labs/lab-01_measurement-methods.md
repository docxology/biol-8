## Part 0: Lab Orientation

> **Learning Goal:** Before we begin measuring objects, scientists must first understand their workspace. Knowing what tools are available—and how to use them safely—is essential for productive research.

Take 5-10 minutes to explore the laboratory environment.

## Part 1: Object Selection

> **Learning Goal:** Practice selecting appropriate subjects for scientific study. Scientists must often decide between studying objects they can directly manipulate and those they can only observe from a distance. This distinction affects methodology significantly.

Choose two objects to study throughout this lab—one that you can directly access and one that you cannot.

<!-- lab:object-selection -->
**Object A (in this room):** {fill:text}

**Object B (NOT in this room):** {fill:text}
<!-- /lab:object-selection -->

**Why did you choose these objects?**

<!-- lab:reflection -->
Consider: What makes them interesting to study? How are they connected to biology or human health?

{fill:textarea rows=3}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

*Pro tip: Choose objects you find genuinely interesting! Object B could be something distant (the moon, a mountain), microscopic (a single cell, bacteria), or simply elsewhere (your car, a tree outside). Think about objects relevant to biology—living organisms, body parts, or items that interact with biological systems.*

## Part 2: Identifying Physical Aspects

> **Learning Goal:** Develop the ability to systematically identify measurable properties and match them with appropriate tools and units. This skill is fundamental to the scientific method. Note the difference between *qualitative* observations (descriptive) and *quantitative* measurements (numerical).

For each object, identify **5 different physical aspects** that could potentially be measured. Physical aspects are quantifiable properties such as length, mass, temperature, volume, surface area, color intensity, hardness, density, or biological metrics like heart rate or growth rate.

### Object A (In Room)

<!-- lab:data-table rows=5 title="Physical Aspects — Object A" -->
| Physical Aspect | Measurement Device | Measurement Unit |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| {fill}          | {fill}            | {fill}           |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Object B (NOT in Room)

<!-- lab:data-table rows=5 title="Physical Aspects — Object B" -->
| Physical Aspect | Measurement Device | Measurement Unit |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| {fill}          | {fill}            | {fill}           |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Reflection: Qualitative vs. Quantitative**

Which of the aspects you listed are truly *quantitative* (can be expressed as a number)? Which might be more *qualitative* (descriptive)? Why does this distinction matter in science?

{fill:textarea rows=3}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

*Hint: Consider both physical properties (mass, length, temperature) and functional properties (speed, frequency, rate of change). For biological objects, think about physiological measurements too. The metric system (meters, grams, liters) is the international standard for scientific measurement.*

## Part 3: Evaluating Measurement Feasibility

> **Learning Goal:** Understand the practical constraints of scientific measurement. Real research requires identifying resources, planning ahead, and sometimes finding creative alternatives. Constraints include time, equipment, access, ethics, and expertise.

Not all measurements are equally accessible. Consider what you could measure *right now* versus what would require additional resources.

### For Object A (In Room)

<!-- lab:measurement-feasibility -->
**Which physical aspects could we measure tonight with available resources?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**For aspects we cannot measure tonight, what would be required?**

Check all that apply:

- [ ] Internet access (for reference data or remote sensing)
- [ ] Money or funding (to purchase equipment)
- [ ] Institutional review or permission (IRB for human subjects)
- [ ] Equipment from another location
- [ ] Specialized training or expertise
- [ ] More time (for longitudinal measurements)
- [ ] Other: {fill:text}

**Explain your reasoning for one aspect that requires additional resources:**

{fill:textarea rows=3}
<!-- /lab:measurement-feasibility -->

### For Object B (NOT in Room)

<!-- lab:measurement-feasibility -->
**What would be required to measure this object's physical aspects?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**What additional challenges exist compared to Object A?**

Check all that apply:

- [ ] Physical access to the object
- [ ] Transportation of measurement equipment
- [ ] Time constraints
- [ ] Cost considerations
- [ ] Safety concerns
- [ ] Ethical considerations (e.g., living organisms, human subjects)
- [ ] Other: {fill:text}

**Explain the most significant challenge:**

{fill:textarea rows=3}
<!-- /lab:measurement-feasibility -->

## Part 4: Making Measurements

> **Learning Goal:** Practice the actual act of measurement, including choosing methods, recording data systematically, and documenting your methodology clearly enough that others could replicate your work. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science.

Now make some actual measurements of **Object A**. You may use formal instruments, estimation, or comparisons—the key is to document what you did and why.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Describe what you measured and how you did it for Object A:**

Include these elements for full credit:

- What aspects did you measure?
- What tools or methods did you use?
- What values did you obtain (with units)?
- What challenges did you encounter?
- How confident are you in your measurements? (high/medium/low and why)

{fill:textarea rows=10}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**For Object B, describe how you would obtain measurements (or explain why direct measurement is not possible):**

What alternative approaches might work? Could you use indirect measurement, estimation, or reference data?

{fill:textarea rows=5}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

## Part 5: Generating Questions from Observations

> **Learning Goal:** Transition from pure measurement to scientific inquiry. The best scientists notice patterns, ask questions, and design experiments to answer them—this is the heart of the scientific method you learned about in Module 01. Remember: *observations* are facts you perceive; *inferences* are conclusions you draw from those facts.

Having examined your objects, now look at them with fresh eyes. What do you notice? What makes you curious?

### Object A

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What did you observe about Object A?** *(Write 2 observations—things you noticed while measuring or examining the object)*

1. {fill:text}

2. {fill:text}

**What questions do you have about Object A?** *(Write 2 questions that your observations raised)*

1. {fill:text}

2. {fill:text}

**For one of your questions, what type of question is it?**

- [ ] Descriptive (What is happening?)
- [ ] Comparative (How do things differ?)
- [ ] Causal (What causes this?)
- [ ] Mechanistic (How does this work?)
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Object B

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What did you observe about Object B?** *(Write 2 observations)*

1. {fill:text}

2. {fill:text}

**What questions do you have about Object B?** *(Write 2 questions)*

1. {fill:text}

2. {fill:text}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

*Pro tip: Good scientific questions often start with "How does...?", "What causes...?", "Why does...?", or "What would happen if...?" These lead to testable hypotheses. Avoid questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no."*

## Part 6: Designing an Investigation

> **Learning Goal:** Connect questions to testable investigations by identifying relevant measurements, expected outcomes, and experimental conditions. This applies the scientific method framework from your Module 01 studies. A good experiment has a clear *independent variable* (what you manipulate) and *dependent variable* (what you measure).

Select **one question** from Part 5 for each object and develop an investigation plan.

### Investigation for Object A

**Selected question:** {fill:text}

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What situations or conditions would help answer this question?**
*(Example: Different temperatures, times of day, locations, or states of the object)*

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**Which measurements from your list would be most relevant?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**What would be your hypothesis?** *(Make a specific, testable prediction using "If... then..." format)*

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**What would be your independent variable (what you change) and dependent variable (what you measure)?**

Independent variable: {fill:text}

Dependent variable: {fill:text}

**What would you keep constant (controlled variables)?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Investigation for Object B

**Selected question:** {fill:text}

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What situations or conditions would help answer this question?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**Which measurements would be most relevant?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**What would be your hypothesis?** *(Use "If... then..." format)*

{fill:textarea rows=2}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

## Part 7: Predicting and Representing Results

> **Learning Goal:** Practice scientific prediction and data visualization—essential skills for testing hypotheses and communicating findings. Scientists must anticipate results to design meaningful experiments. Different types of data require different visualization approaches.

Choose one investigation from Part 6 and think through what results might look like.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What might typical results look like?**
*(Describe specific numbers, patterns, or trends you might observe)*

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**How would you interpret different possible outcomes?**

| If results show... | This would suggest... |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Higher values | {fill} |
| Lower values | {fill} |
| No pattern | {fill} |
| Unexpected pattern | {fill} |

**How would you visually represent this data?**
*(Describe or sketch: bar graph, line chart, scatter plot, table, diagram, etc. Explain why this format is appropriate for your data type.)*

{fill:textarea rows=4}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

---

## Part 8: Communicating Your Research

> **Learning Goal:** Understand that scientific work is incomplete until it is shared. Scientists communicate findings through papers, presentations, and discussions—this is how knowledge advances. Clear communication allows others to build on your work and verify your findings.

Science is a collaborative endeavor. Discoveries only advance knowledge when they are communicated clearly to others.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Why is it important to communicate scientific findings?**

Consider: How does sharing results benefit other scientists? How does it benefit society? What happens when research is not shared? What role does peer review play?

{fill:textarea rows=4}

**Summarize what you learned from this investigation in 2-3 sentences, as if explaining to a classmate who wasn't in lab today:**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**What are the next steps you would take in this investigation, and why?**

Consider: What follow-up questions emerged? What would you measure differently? What new conditions would you test? What equipment would help? How would you increase sample size or reduce error?

{fill:textarea rows=4}

**What limitations or uncertainties exist in your current findings?**

Consider: measurement error, sample size, time constraints, equipment limitations, assumptions made.

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**Connection to Module 01:** This lab directly applies the scientific method you learned about in "Exploring Life Science." You practiced making observations, distinguishing observations from inferences, forming hypotheses, identifying variables, controlling experiments, and communicating results—the same process used by scientists worldwide to understand the living world.

**Key Takeaway:** Scientific measurement is not just about collecting numbers—it begins with curiosity, requires careful planning, and culminates in communicating discoveries and identifying new questions to pursue. This cycle of inquiry drives all biological research, from molecular biology to ecology to human health.
