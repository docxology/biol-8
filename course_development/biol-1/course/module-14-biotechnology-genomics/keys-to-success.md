# Module 14: Biotechnology and Genomics
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Explain** the function of restriction enzymes and DNA ligase in creating recombinant DNA.
2.  **Describe** the steps and purpose of PCR and gel electrophoresis.
3.  **Evaluate** the benefits and risks of transgenic organisms (GMOs).
4.  **Discuss** the goals and methods of gene therapy.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Recombinant DNA**: DNA containing genetic material from two different sources.
- [ ] **Plasmid**: A small circular DNA molecule in bacteria, often used as a cloning vector.
- [ ] **DNA Ligase**: An enzyme that seals breaks in the DNA backbone.
- [ ] **STR (Short Tandem Repeat)**: Highly variable DNA sequences used in genetic fingerprinting.
- [ ] **Bioinformatics**: The use of computational tools to analyze biological data.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Molecular Cloning
*   **Question**: What enzymes are used to create recombinant DNA?
*   **Key Answer**:
    *   **Restriction enzymes**: Cut DNA at specific recognition sequences, generating sticky or blunt ends.
    *   **DNA ligase**: Joins DNA fragments together.

#### 2. Gel Electrophoresis
*   **Question**: How does gel electrophoresis separate DNA?
*   **Key Answer**: DNA is negatively charged (phosphate groups). In an electric field, DNA migrates toward the positive electrode. Smaller fragments move faster/farther through the gel matrix.

#### 3. Transgenic Organisms
*   **Question**: What are applications of transgenic technology?
*   **Key Answer**:
    *   **Bacteria**: Production of insulin, human growth hormone.
    *   **Plants**: Golden Rice (Vitamin A), pest-resistant crops.
    *   **Animals**: Pharmaceutical production in milk.
