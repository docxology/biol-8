Module 2: Biodiversity and Conservation

What is Biodiversity?

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth at all levels:
Genetic Diversity: Variation within species
Species Diversity: Variety of species in an area
Ecosystem Diversity: Variety of ecosystems

Importance of Biodiversity

Ecosystem Services

Biodiversity provides essential services:
Provisioning: Food, water, medicine, materials
Regulating: Climate, disease, water quality
Cultural: Recreation, aesthetic, spiritual
Supporting: Nutrient cycling, soil formation

Economic Value

Tourism and recreation
Pharmaceutical discoveries
Agricultural diversity
Ecosystem stability

Threats to Biodiversity

Habitat Loss

Deforestation
Urbanization
Agriculture expansion
Most significant threat to biodiversity

Climate Change

Shifting temperature and precipitation
Sea level rise
Ocean acidification
Altered migration patterns

Invasive Species

Non-native species that outcompete natives
Disrupt ecosystem balance
Examples: Zebra mussels, kudzu, cane toads

Overexploitation

Overhunting and overfishing
Illegal wildlife trade
Unsustainable harvesting

Pollution

Chemical contaminants
Plastic pollution
Nutrient runoff
Air and water pollution

Conservation Strategies

Protected Areas

National parks
Wildlife reserves
Marine protected areas
Habitat corridors

Species Conservation

Captive breeding programs
Reintroduction efforts
Habitat restoration
Legal protection

Sustainable Practices

Sustainable agriculture
Responsible fishing
Forest management
Renewable energy

Measuring Biodiversity

Species Richness

Number of different species in an area.

Species Evenness

Relative abundance of different species.
