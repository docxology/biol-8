## Part 1: Background & Key Concepts

Before we begin the hands-on activities, let's review the essential vocabulary and ideas behind inheritance.

### What Is Inheritance?

Every living thing inherits its traits from its parents. You got half of your DNA from your biological mother and half from your biological father. The study of how these traits are passed from one generation to the next is called **genetics**. The modern science of genetics was founded by **Gregor Mendel**, who experimented with pea plants in the 1860s.

### Key Terminology

Study the following terms carefully. You will use all of them throughout this lab.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Gene** | A segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait (e.g., eye color, blood type) |
| **Allele** | A specific version of a gene. For example, the gene for flower color may have a "purple" allele and a "white" allele |
| **Genotype** | The combination of alleles an organism carries (written with letters, e.g., *AA*, *Aa*, or *aa*) |
| **Phenotype** | The physical, observable expression of a trait (e.g., "purple flowers" or "brown eyes") |
| **Homozygous** | Having **two identical** alleles for a trait — either *AA* (homozygous dominant) or *aa* (homozygous recessive) |
| **Heterozygous** | Having **two different** alleles for a trait (*Aa*); sometimes called a **carrier** if the trait is recessive |
| **Dominant** | An allele whose effect is seen even when only one copy is present. Written as a **capital letter** (e.g., **A**) |
| **Recessive** | An allele whose effect is only seen when **two copies** are present. Written as a **lowercase letter** (e.g., **a**) |
| **Carrier** | An individual who is heterozygous for a recessive trait — they don't show it but can pass it to offspring |
| **Punnett Square** | A grid used to predict the genotype and phenotype ratios of offspring from a genetic cross |
| **Law of Segregation** | During gamete (egg/sperm) formation, the two alleles for a gene separate so each gamete carries only *one* allele |
| **Autosomal** | A gene located on one of the 22 non-sex chromosomes (chromosomes 1–22) |
| **Sex-linked** | A gene located on the **X chromosome**. Males (XY) have only one copy, so they express whatever allele is on their X |

### Conceptual Review

Answer these questions **before** starting the exercises. Use the terminology table above.

## Part 2: The Coin Toss — Probability & Allele Segregation

> **Learning Goal:** Understand how random chance determines which alleles are passed to offspring.

Sexual reproduction involves chance. During meiosis, the two alleles in a parent separate (segregate), so a parent passes only *one* of their two alleles to each offspring. Which one they pass is random — like flipping a coin.

### Procedure

Imagine both parents are **heterozygous (Aa)** for a trait.

- **Heads** = Dominant allele (**A**)
- **Tails** = Recessive allele (**a**)

1. **Get two coins.** One represents the **Father (Aa)**, the other represents the **Mother (Aa)**.
2. **Flip both coins simultaneously 10 times.**
3. Record the combination for each toss in the tally table below.
   - **Heads/Heads** = **AA** (Homozygous Dominant)
   - **Heads/Tails** or **Tails/Heads** = **Aa** (Heterozygous)
   - **Tails/Tails** = **aa** (Homozygous Recessive)

### Data Collection

<!-- lab:data-table rows=4 title="Genotype Tally Sheet (10 Tosses)" -->
| Genotype | Tally (mark each toss) | Total Count | Percentage (Count ÷ 10 × 100) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AA** (Heads/Heads) | {fill:text} | {fill:number} | {fill:number}% |
| **Aa** (Heads/Tails) | {fill:text} | {fill:number} | {fill:number}% |
| **aa** (Tails/Tails) | {fill:text} | {fill:number} | {fill:number}% |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Analysis

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. Theoretically, a cross between two heterozygotes (Aa × Aa) should produce 25% AA, 50% Aa, and 25% aa. How close were your results?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**2. You only did 10 flips. Do you think your results would be closer to the theoretical percentages if you flipped 100 times? Why?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**3. Explain in your own words how this coin flip models what actually happens during meiosis when alleles segregate.**

## Part 3: Monohybrid Crosses — Albinism in Humans

> **Learning Goal:** Use Punnett squares to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes for a single trait.

Albinism (lack of skin pigment) is an **autosomal recessive** condition.

- **A** = Normal pigmentation (Dominant)
- **a** = Albinism (Recessive)

### Problem 1

A man who is **homozygous dominant (AA)** has children with a woman who is **albino (aa)**.

Draw the Punnett square:

```
       __a__   __a__
     |       |       |
   A |       |       |
     |_______|_______|
     |       |       |
   A |       |       |
     |_______|_______|
```

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**What is the genotype of all offspring?**
{fill:text}

**What is the phenotype of all offspring?**
{fill:text}

**Could any of the offspring be albino? Why or why not?**
{fill:textarea rows=2}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Problem 2

Now suppose one of the children from Problem 1 (who is **heterozygous, Aa**) marries another person who is also **heterozygous (Aa)**.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Draw the Punnett square for Aa × Aa in the space below or on scratch paper.**

**What are the expected genotypic percentages?**

- AA: {fill:text}%
- Aa: {fill:text}%
- aa: {fill:text}%

**What fraction of the offspring would you expect to be albino?**
{fill:text}

**What fraction would be carriers (heterozygous) but appear normal?**
{fill:text}

## Part 4: Dragon Genetics 🐉

> **Learning Goal:** Apply Punnett squares to a fun, fictional organism and predict offspring traits.

Welcome to the **Dragon Hatchery!** In this exercise, you will cross dragons and predict what their baby dragons will look like. Dragon traits follow simple Mendelian inheritance.

### Dragon Trait Guide

| Trait | Dominant Phenotype | Dominant Allele | Recessive Phenotype | Recessive Allele |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Breath** | Fire-breathing 🔥 | **F** | Ice-breathing ❄️ | **f** |
| **Wing Shape** | Pointed wings 🦇 | **W** | Rounded wings 🪽 | **w** |
| **Scale Color** | Green scales 🟢 | **G** | Gold scales 🟡 | **g** |

### Cross 1: Fire or Ice?

**Mother Dragon:** Heterozygous fire-breather (**Ff**)
**Father Dragon:** Heterozygous fire-breather (**Ff**)

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Set up the Punnett square for Ff × Ff.**

**Out of 4 baby dragons, how many would you expect to breathe fire?** {fill:number}

**Out of 4 baby dragons, how many would you expect to breathe ice?** {fill:number}

**What is the probability (as a fraction) of a baby dragon being an ice-breather?** {fill:text}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Cross 2: The Mystery Dragon

A **gold-scaled dragon (gg)** mates with a **green-scaled dragon whose genotype is unknown**.

They produce 8 baby dragons. **All 8** have green scales.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Based on this result, what is the most likely genotype of the green-scaled parent? (GG or Gg?) Explain your reasoning.**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**If the green-scaled parent had been heterozygous (Gg), what fraction of the offspring would you expect to have gold scales?**
{fill:text}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Cross 3: Design Your Dragon

Now it's your turn! You will design a pair of parent dragons and predict their offspring.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Choose ONE trait from the Dragon Trait Guide.**

**Trait chosen:** {fill:text}

**Mother's genotype:** {fill:text} → **Phenotype:** {fill:text}

**Father's genotype:** {fill:text} → **Phenotype:** {fill:text}

**Draw the Punnett square and list the predicted offspring genotypes and phenotypes below.**

{fill:textarea rows=4}

**BONUS:** Draw or describe one of the baby dragons. What does it look like? What does it breathe?

## Part 5: My Traits — Dominant vs. Recessive in Humans

> **Learning Goal:** Observe dominant and recessive traits in yourself and classmates.

Many human traits are complex and influenced by multiple genes, but some behave (mostly) like simple Mendelian traits. Check yourself for each trait below.

### Data Collection

Determine your **phenotype** for each trait and your **possible genotype(s)**. Remember: if you show the dominant phenotype, you could be homozygous dominant *or* heterozygous — write the genotype with an underscore (e.g., **T_**) to show the uncertainty.

<!-- lab:data-table rows=5 title="My Genetic Profile" -->
| Trait | Dominant | Recessive | My Phenotype | My Possible Genotype(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tongue Rolling | Can roll (**T**) | Cannot roll (**t**) | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
| Earlobes | Free / unattached (**E**) | Attached (**e**) | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
| Widow's Peak | Peak hairline (**W**) | Straight hairline (**w**) | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
| Hitchhiker's Thumb | Straight thumb (**H**) | Bends back ≥ 90° (**h**) | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Analysis

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. For any trait where you show the recessive phenotype, what must your genotype be? Why can you be certain?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**2. For a trait where you show the dominant phenotype, why can't you determine your exact genotype just by looking?**

## Part 6: Superhero Genetics 🦸 — Sex-Linked Inheritance

> **Learning Goal:** Understand how genes on the X chromosome are inherited differently in males and females.

Genes located on the **X chromosome** follow a special inheritance pattern. Males (XY) have only *one* X chromosome, so they express *whatever allele* is on it — even if it's recessive. Females (XX) have two copies, so a recessive allele can be masked by a dominant one.

### The Superhero Trait

In this fictional scenario, the ability to fly is controlled by a gene on the X chromosome.

- **X<sup>F</sup>** = Flying ability (Dominant)
- **X<sup>f</sup>** = No flying ability (Recessive)

Since the gene is on the X chromosome, males need only **one** recessive allele to be unable to fly, while females need **two**.

| Genotype | Sex | Phenotype |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| X<sup>F</sup>X<sup>F</sup> | Female | Can fly |
| X<sup>F</sup>X<sup>f</sup> | Female | Can fly (carrier) |
| X<sup>f</sup>X<sup>f</sup> | Female | Cannot fly |
| X<sup>F</sup>Y | Male | Can fly |
| X<sup>f</sup>Y | Male | Cannot fly |

### Problem: The Superhero Family

A **carrier mother (X<sup>F</sup>X<sup>f</sup>)** who can fly has children with a **father who can fly (X<sup>F</sup>Y)**.

1. Set up the Punnett square:

```
          X꞉F      X꞉f
       ________________
  X꞉F |        |        |
      |________|________|
  Y   |        |        |
      |________|________|
```

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. Fill in the four offspring genotypes from the Punnett square.**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**2. What is the probability of having a DAUGHTER who cannot fly?**
{fill:text}

**3. What is the probability of having a SON who cannot fly?**
{fill:text}

**4. Could any of their daughters be carriers? If so, what is the probability?**
{fill:text}

**5. Explain why sons are more likely than daughters to lack the flying ability, even though both parents can fly.**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**6. This pattern is the same one seen in real human X-linked traits like color blindness and hemophilia. Why are these conditions much more common in males?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}
