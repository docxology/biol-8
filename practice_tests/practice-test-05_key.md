# Practice Test 05 — Answer Key

## Module 9: Inheritance

---

## Part A: Multiple Choice

1. **B** — An alternate form of a gene is an allele.
2. **B** — Two identical alleles (AA) = homozygous dominant.
3. **B** — The physical appearance (what you observe) is the phenotype.
4. **B** — Two different alleles (Aa) = heterozygous.
5. **C** — Tt × tt → 50% Tt (tall), 50% tt (short). Probability of short = 50%.
6. **A** — Aa × Aa → 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa. Only 1/4 (aa) shows recessive phenotype.
7. **C** — Incomplete dominance produces an intermediate (blended) phenotype.
8. **B** — Blood type AB is codominance; both A and B antigens are expressed simultaneously.
9. **B** — Genes on the X chromosome produce sex-linked traits.
10. **B** — Males have only one X, so a single recessive allele on the X is expressed (no second X to mask it).
11. **C** — A pedigree tracks traits across generations in a family.
12. **B** — In a pedigree, filled-in circles = affected females; filled-in squares = affected males.
13. **B** — RW × RW → 1 RR (Red) : 2 RW (Pink) : 1 WW (White). This is the hallmark of incomplete dominance.
14. **C** — aa is homozygous recessive (two copies of the recessive allele).
15. **B** — Gregor Mendel is the "Father of Genetics" based on his pea plant experiments.
16. **C** — X^C X^c × X^C Y → Sons: 50% X^C Y (normal), 50% X^c Y (color blind). So 50% of sons will be color blind.

## Part B: Fill in the Blank

1. **Pea** (Pisum sativum)
2. **Phenotype**; **Genotype**
3. **Recessive**
4. **Dihybrid**
5. **Polygenic**

## Part C: Short Answer

1. **Punnett Square: Aa × Aa**

    |   | **A** | **a** |
    |---|-------|-------|
    | **A** | AA | Aa |
    | **a** | Aa | aa |

    - **Genotypic ratio:** 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa
    - **Phenotypic ratio:** 3 dominant : 1 recessive

2. **Incomplete Dominance vs. Codominance:**
    - **Incomplete dominance:** The heterozygous phenotype is a blend of the two homozygous phenotypes. Example: Red × White snapdragons → Pink offspring.
    - **Codominance:** Both alleles are fully expressed simultaneously in the heterozygote. Example: Blood type AB (I^A I^B) where both A and B antigens appear on the red blood cell surface.
    - Key difference: Incomplete dominance blends the phenotypes; codominance displays both phenotypes at the same time.

3. **Color Blindness Cross: X^c Y × X^C X^c**

    |   | **X^C** | **X^c** |
    |---|---------|---------|
    | **X^c** | X^C X^c (carrier daughter) | X^c X^c (color blind daughter) |
    | **Y** | X^C Y (normal son) | X^c Y (color blind son) |

    - Probability of daughters being color blind: **50%** (1 out of 2 daughters)
    - Probability of sons being color blind: **50%** (1 out of 2 sons)

4. **Definitions:**
    - **Allele:** An alternate form of a gene (e.g., T for tall, t for short).
    - **Genotype:** The genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., Tt, AA, aa).
    - **Phenotype:** The observable physical traits of an organism (e.g., tall, short, brown eyes).
    - **Dominant:** The allele that is expressed in the heterozygote. Only one copy is needed to show the trait (e.g., T in Tt).
    - **Recessive:** The allele that is masked in the heterozygote. Two copies are needed to show the trait (e.g., t in tt).
