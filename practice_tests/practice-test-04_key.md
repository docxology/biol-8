# Practice Test 04 — Answer Key

## Modules 8-9: Cell Division & Inheritance

---

## Part A: Multiple Choice

### Module 8: Cell Division

1. **B** — DNA is replicated during S (Synthesis) phase.
2. **C** — Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase (PMAT).
3. **B** — Chromosomes line up at the cell equator during Metaphase.
4. **A** — Mitosis produces two genetically identical diploid cells.
5. **B** — Meiosis occurs only in germ cells to produce gametes (sex cells).
6. **B** — Crossing over occurs during Prophase I of Meiosis.
7. **C** — Gametes are haploid (n), so 46/2 = 23 chromosomes.
8. **B** — Nondisjunction can result in trisomy conditions like Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21).

### Module 9: Inheritance

1. **B** — An alternate form of a gene is an allele.
2. **B** — Two identical alleles (AA) = homozygous dominant.
3. **C** — Tt × tt → 50% Tt (tall), 50% tt (short). Probability of short = 50%.
4. **C** — Incomplete dominance produces an intermediate (blended) phenotype.
5. **B** — Blood type AB is codominance; both A and B antigens are expressed.
6. **B** — Genes on the X chromosome produce sex-linked traits.
7. **B** — Males have only one X, so a single recessive allele on the X is expressed (no second X to mask it).
8. **C** — A pedigree tracks traits across generations in a family.

## Part B: Fill in the Blank

1. **Cytokinesis**
2. **Gametes** (sex cells / sperm and eggs)
3. **Cancer**
4. **Genetics**
5. **Phenotype**; **Genotype**
6. **Recessive**

## Part C: Short Answer

1. **Three Differences Between Mitosis and Meiosis:**

    | Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    | Divisions | 1 | 2 |
    | Result | 2 identical diploid cells | 4 unique haploid cells |
    | Purpose | Growth and repair | Produce gametes |
    | Crossing over | No | Yes (Prophase I) |

2. **Punnett Square: Aa × Aa**

    |   | **A** | **a** |
    |---|-------|-------|
    | **A** | AA | Aa |
    | **a** | Aa | aa |

    - **Genotypic ratio:** 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa
    - **Phenotypic ratio:** 3 dominant : 1 recessive

3. **Independent Assortment:**
    Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment states that genes for different traits are sorted into gametes independently of one another. This occurs during Metaphase I of meiosis, when homologous chromosome pairs line up randomly at the cell equator. This means the allele a gamete receives for one gene does not affect which allele it receives for another gene (as long as they are on different chromosomes).
