## Part A: Multiple Choice Answers

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|:---:|:------:|-------------|
| 1 | B | Proteins float within a flexible phospholipid bilayer — the "fluid mosaic" |
| 2 | C | Hydrophobic tails face inward, away from water, toward each other |
| 3 | B | Cholesterol buffers membrane fluidity — prevents too rigid in cold or too fluid in heat |
| 4 | B | Integral (transmembrane) proteins span the entire bilayer from one side to the other |
| 5 | B | Glycoproteins serve as identification markers for cell recognition and signaling |
| 6 | C | Selectively permeable = allows some substances through but not others based on size, charge, polarity |
| 7 | B | Simple diffusion moves molecules down their gradient, no energy, no proteins needed |
| 8 | C | Facilitated diffusion is passive but uses channel or carrier proteins to assist transport |
| 9 | B | Osmosis = water movement across a selectively permeable membrane toward higher solute concentration |
| 10 | C | Hypotonic = less solute outside → water enters the cell → swelling → possible lysis |
| 11 | B | Hypertonic = more solute outside → water leaves → plasma membrane pulls from cell wall (plasmolysis) |
| 12 | C | Na⁺/K⁺ pump uses ATP to move ions against their concentration gradient = active transport |
| 13 | C | Phagocytosis = "cell eating" — the membrane wraps around and engulfs large solid particles |
| 14 | B | Pure water is hypotonic to blood cells; water would rush in by osmosis, causing cells to lyse |
| 15 | C | Aquaporins are specialized channel proteins for rapid water transport across membranes |
| 16 | B | Catabolism = breaking down complex molecules, releasing energy (e.g., glucose → CO₂ + ATP) |
| 17 | B | Anabolism = building complex molecules from simple ones, requiring energy input |
| 18 | C | ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the cell's energy currency |
| 19 | C | Energy is stored in the phosphoanhydride bonds between the phosphate groups |
| 20 | B | Enzymes lower activation energy, allowing reactions to proceed faster at body temperature |
| 21 | B | Induced fit = the active site adjusts its shape slightly to bind the substrate more tightly |
| 22 | B | Competitive inhibitors mimic the substrate and bind directly to the active site, blocking it |
| 23 | B | Noncompetitive inhibitors bind elsewhere on the enzyme, distorting the active site shape |
| 24 | B | Feedback inhibition = the end product shuts down an earlier enzyme in its own production pathway |
| 25 | B | Glucose + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP (the overall equation for cellular respiration) |
| 26 | C | Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm (does not require mitochondria) |
| 27 | B | The citric acid cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix |
| 28 | B | The ETC is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (cristae) |
| 29 | C | Fermentation produces ATP without oxygen (anaerobic pathway) |
| 30 | D | Aerobic respiration yields approximately 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule |
| 31 | C | Adenine pairs with Thymine in DNA (A-T) |
| 32 | C | Replication makes an exact copy of DNA |
| 33 | B | DNA Polymerase adds nucleotides during replication |
| 34 | A | Transcription occurs in the nucleus (in eukaryotes) |
| 35 | B | Transcription produces mRNA from DNA template |
| 36 | C | mRNA is the template read by ribosomes |
| 37 | C | A codon is 3 nucleotides |
| 38 | B | Translation occurs at ribosomes in the cytoplasm |
| 39 | B | tRNA brings amino acids to the ribosome |
| 40 | C | Silent mutations do not change the amino acid sequence |
| 41 | D | Both DNA and RNA have phosphate groups (backbone) |
| 42 | B | DNA → RNA → Protein |
| 43 | B | Complementary to TAC is AUG (A pairs with U in RNA) |
| 44 | A | Sickle cell is a point mutation (Glu -> Val) |
| 45 | C | Signals the ribosome to stop knowing translation |

## Part C: Short Answer Key

**61. Passive vs. Active Transport:**

- **Passive**: No ATP, moves down gradient (e.g., Osmosis).
- **Active**: Requires ATP, moves against gradient (e.g., Na+/K+ pump).

**62. Tonicity:**

- **Isotonic**: No net movement.
- **Hypertonic**: Water leaves (Crenation).
- **Hypotonic**: Water enters (Lysis).

**63. Enzymes:**

- Catalysts with **active site**.
- **Induced Fit**: Changes shape to bind substrate.
- **Denatured**: Shape lost, active site destroyed (temp/pH).

**64. Respiration Stages:**

1. **Glycolysis** (Cytoplasm): Glucose -> Pyruvate + 2 ATP.
2. **Citric Acid Cycle** (Matrix): Acetyl-CoA -> CO2 + 2 ATP + NADH/FADH2.
3. **ETC** (Inner Membrane): NADH/FADH2 + O2 -> H2O + ~32-34 ATP.

**65. Fermentation vs Aerobic:**

- **Lactic Acid**: Produces lactic acid (muscles).
- **Alcoholic**: Produces ethanol + CO2 (yeast).
- Less ATP (2 vs 36) because no ETC/Oxygen to fully oxidize glucose.

**66. Central Dogma:**

- **DNA** (in nucleus) is transcribed into **mRNA**.
- **mRNA** travels to cytoplasm/ribosome.
- **Ribosome** translates mRNA into **Protein** (using tRNA).

**67. Point vs Frameshift:**

- **Point**: Change one base. Can be silent, missense, or nonsense.
- **Frameshift**: Insertion/Deletion. Changes reading frame.
- **Frameshift is worse** because it alters every amino acid downstream, usually resulting in a nonfunctional protein.
