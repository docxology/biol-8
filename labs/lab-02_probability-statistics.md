## Introduction

Probability plays a fundamental role in biology. From genetics (inheritance patterns) to ecology (population dynamics) to medicine (disease risk), understanding probability helps us make predictions and interpret data. In this lab, we'll use simple tools—coins and dice—to explore probability concepts that apply directly to biological studies.

**Key Terms:**

- **Theoretical probability**: What we *expect* to happen based on mathematics
- **Experimental probability**: What we *actually observe* when performing an experiment
- **Sample size**: The number of trials or observations in an experiment
- **Random event**: An outcome that cannot be predicted with certainty

---

## Part 1: Coin Flipping — Single Coin

> **Learning Goal:** Understand how theoretical probability compares to experimental results, and how sample size affects accuracy.

### Background

A fair coin has two sides (heads and tails). Each flip is an independent event.

**Theoretical Probability:**

- P(Heads) = 1/2 = 0.50 = 50%
- P(Tails) = 1/2 = 0.50 = 50%

### Hypothesis

<!-- lab:reflection -->
Based on theoretical probability, write your hypothesis for 20 coin flips:

**If** I flip a fair coin 20 times, **then** I expect to get approximately {fill:text} heads and {fill:text} tails, **because** {fill:text}.
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Procedure

1. Obtain one coin from the lab instructor
2. Flip the coin 20 times
3. Record each result immediately in the data table below
4. Calculate your experimental probability

### Data Collection

<!-- lab:data-table rows=20 title="Coin Flip Data — 20 Trials" -->
| Result (H or T) |
|-----------------|
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Calculations

<!-- lab:calculation -->
**Count your results:**

| Outcome | Count | Experimental Probability |
|---------|-------|-------------------------|
| Heads   | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 20 = {fill:number} |
| Tails   | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 20 = {fill:number} |
| **Total** | 20 | 1.00 |

**Calculating Experimental Probability:**

```
Experimental Probability = (Number of desired outcomes) ÷ (Total number of trials)

P(Heads) = _____ ÷ 20 = _____
P(Tails) = _____ ÷ 20 = _____
```

## Part 2: Effect of Sample Size

> **Learning Goal:** Discover how increasing sample size improves the match between experimental and theoretical probability—a crucial concept in statistical analysis.

### Class Data Compilation

<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Comparison

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Compare your individual results to the class results:**

| Measure | Your Data (n=20) | Class Data (n=___) | Theoretical |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| P(Heads) | {fill} | {fill} | 0.50 |
| P(Tails) | {fill} | {fill} | 0.50 |
| Difference from theoretical | {fill} | {fill} | 0 |

## Part 3: Die Rolling — Single Die

> **Learning Goal:** Apply probability concepts to a different random event with 6 possible outcomes. Calculate probabilities for more complex events.

### Background

A fair 6-sided die has 6 outcomes, each equally likely.

**Theoretical Probability for each number:**

- P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = P(6) = 1/6 ≈ 0.167 ≈ 16.7%

### Hypothesis

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**If** I roll a fair die 30 times, **then** I expect each number to appear approximately {fill:text} times, **because** {fill:text}.

**Calculate the expected number of times each value should appear:**

Expected frequency = (Probability) × (Number of trials) = (1/6) × 30 = {fill:number}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Procedure

1. Obtain one 6-sided die from the lab instructor
2. Roll the die 30 times
3. Record each result using tally marks
4. Count and calculate probabilities

### Data Collection

<!-- lab:data-table rows=6 title="Die Roll Data — 30 Trials" -->
| Die Value | Tally (use marks: |||| ) | Count | Experimental Probability |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------|--------------------------|
| 1         | {fill}                  | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} |
| 2         | {fill}                  | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} |
| 3         | {fill}                  | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} |
| 4         | {fill}                  | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} |
| 5         | {fill}                  | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} |
| 6         | {fill}                  | {fill:number} | {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} |
| **Total** |                         | 30    | 1.00 |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Calculations and Analysis

<!-- lab:calculation -->
**Calculate probabilities for compound events:**

**1. P(rolling an even number) — rolling 2, 4, or 6:**

Theoretical: P(even) = 3/6 = 0.50 = 50%

Your experimental result:
Count of even rolls (2 + 4 + 6): {fill:number}
P(even) = {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} = {fill:number}%

**2. P(rolling greater than 4) — rolling 5 or 6:**

Theoretical: P(>4) = 2/6 = 0.333 = 33.3%

Your experimental result:
Count of 5s and 6s: {fill:number}
P(>4) = {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} = {fill:number}%

**3. P(rolling 1 or 6):**

Theoretical: P(1 or 6) = 2/6 = 0.333 = 33.3%

Your experimental result:
Count of 1s and 6s: {fill:number}
P(1 or 6) = {fill:number} ÷ 30 = {fill:number} = {fill:number}%
<!-- /lab:calculation -->

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Comparison of Expected vs. Observed:**

| Die Value | Expected Count (30 × 1/6 = 5) | Observed Count | Difference |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------|------------|
| 1         | 5                            | {fill:number}  | {fill:number} |
| 2         | 5                            | {fill:number}  | {fill:number} |
| 3         | 5                            | {fill:number}  | {fill:number} |
| 4         | 5                            | {fill:number}  | {fill:number} |
| 5         | 5                            | {fill:number}  | {fill:number} |
| 6         | 5                            | {fill:number}  | {fill:number} |

**Which value appeared most often? Least often?**

Most: {fill:text} | Least: {fill:text}

**Does this mean the die was unfair? Explain your reasoning:**

## Part 4: Two Dice — Combined Probabilities

> **Learning Goal:** Understand how combining independent events creates more complex probability distributions, similar to how traits combine in genetics.

### Background

When rolling two dice, the outcomes combine. While each die is independent, some sums are more likely than others:

| Sum | Number of Ways | Theoretical Probability |
|-----|---------------|------------------------|
| 2   | 1 (1+1)       | 1/36 = 2.8% |
| 3   | 2             | 2/36 = 5.6% |
| 4   | 3             | 3/36 = 8.3% |
| 5   | 4             | 4/36 = 11.1% |
| 6   | 5             | 5/36 = 13.9% |
| 7   | 6             | 6/36 = 16.7% |
| 8   | 5             | 5/36 = 13.9% |
| 9   | 4             | 4/36 = 11.1% |
| 10  | 3             | 3/36 = 8.3% |
| 11  | 2             | 2/36 = 5.6% |
| 12  | 1 (6+6)       | 1/36 = 2.8% |

*Note: See Dashboard 2 for an interactive visualization of this probability distribution. The key insight is that 7 is the most probable sum because it has the most combinations (6 ways to roll a 7).*

| 7   | {fill} | {fill:number} | 6                      | {fill:number} |
| 8   | {fill} | {fill:number} | 5                      | {fill:number} |
| 9   | {fill} | {fill:number} | 4                      | {fill:number} |
| 10  | {fill} | {fill:number} | 3                      | {fill:number} |
| 11  | {fill} | {fill:number} | 2                      | {fill:number} |
| 12  | {fill} | {fill:number} | 1                      | {fill:number} |
| **Total** | | 36 | 36 | |

## Part 5: Application to Biology

> **Learning Goal:** Connect probability concepts to real biological phenomena, particularly genetics.

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. In genetics, a heterozygous cross (Aa × Aa) has the following offspring probabilities:**

**Punnett Square (Aa × Aa):**

|               | Parent 1: **A** | Parent 1: **a** |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Parent 2: **A** | AA           | Aa              |
| Parent 2: **a** | Aa           | aa              |

**Results:** 1 AA : 2 Aa : 1 aa

| Genotype | Probability | Percentage |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| AA       | 1/4         | 25%        |
| Aa       | 2/4         | 50%        |
| aa       | 1/4         | 25%        |

**How is this similar to rolling dice or flipping coins?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**2. A couple plans to have 4 children. If the probability of having a boy or girl is 50% (like a coin flip), complete this prediction:**

| Outcome | Expected Number in 4 Children |
|---------|------------------------------|
| All boys | 4 × (1/16) = 0.25 |
| 3 boys, 1 girl | 4 × (4/16) = {fill:number} |
| 2 boys, 2 girls | 4 × (6/16) = {fill:number} |
| 1 boy, 3 girls | 4 × (4/16) = {fill:number} |
| All girls | 4 × (1/16) = 0.25 |

**3. Why do real-world genetic outcomes sometimes differ from theoretical expectations?**
