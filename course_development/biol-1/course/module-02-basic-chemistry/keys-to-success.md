# Module 2: Basic Chemistry
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Describe** the structure of an atom and the properties of its subatomic particles.
2.  **Compare** and **contrast** ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds.
3.  **Explain** the unique life-supporting properties of water resulting from its polarity.
4.  **Interpret** the pH scale and explain the importance of buffers in maintaining homeostasis.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Matter**: Anything that has mass and occupies space.
- [ ] **Isotope**: Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.
- [ ] **Valence Shell**: The outermost electron shell, which determines an atom's reactivity.
- [ ] **Cation vs. Anion**: A positively charged ion (lost electrons) vs. a negatively charged ion (gained electrons).
- [ ] **Electronegativity**: A measure of an atom's ability to attract shared electrons in a bond.
- [ ] **Solute vs. Solvent**: The substance being dissolved vs. the dissolving medium.
- [ ] **Hydrophilic vs. Hydrophobic**: Water-attracting vs. water-repelling.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Atomic Structure
*   **Question**: How are Atomic Number and Mass Number determined?
*   **Key Answer**: Atomic Number = number of protons (defines the element). Mass Number = protons + neutrons.
*   **Application**: Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Carbon-14 (an isotope) has 6 protons and 8 neutrons.

#### 2. Chemical Bonding
*   **Question**: How do ionic and covalent bonds differ?
*   **Key Answer**: In **ionic bonds**, electrons are transferred (e.g., NaCl). In **covalent bonds**, electrons are shared (e.g., H₂O). Hydrogen bonds are weak attractions between polar molecules.

#### 3. Properties of Water
*   **Question**: Why is water essential for life?
*   **Key Answer**: Water's polarity leads to hydrogen bonding, which gives it high specific heat, cohesion, adhesion, and solvent properties. Ice floats because water expands upon freezing.

#### 4. pH and Buffers
*   **Question**: What is the pH scale and why do buffers matter?
*   **Key Answer**: pH measures hydrogen ion concentration (0-14 scale; 7 is neutral). Buffers resist pH changes by absorbing or releasing H⁺ ions, critical for enzyme function.
