Module 15: Respiratory System — Keys to Success

Key Learning Objectives

Respiratory System Overview
Describe the primary functions of the respiratory system
Distinguish between external and internal respiration
Explain the relationship between the respiratory and cardiovascular systems
Understand the role of respiration in pH balance

Anatomy of the Respiratory System
Identify the structures of the upper respiratory tract (nose, pharynx, larynx)
Identify the structures of the lower respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli)
Describe the structure and function of the alveoli
Explain the role of surfactant in lung function

Mechanics of Breathing
Describe the process of inspiration and expiration
Explain the role of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles
Understand how pressure changes drive breathing
Define respiratory volumes and capacities

Gas Exchange
Explain how gases are exchanged in the alveoli
Describe the factors that affect gas exchange
Understand the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide
Explain the relationship between alveolar structure and gas exchange efficiency

Gas Transport in Blood
Describe how oxygen is transported in the blood
Explain the role of hemoglobin in oxygen transport
Describe how carbon dioxide is transported in the blood
Understand the relationship between oxygen-hemoglobin saturation and tissue needs

Control of Breathing
Explain how the brain controls breathing rate
Describe the role of chemoreceptors in regulating respiration
Understand how CO₂ and O₂ levels affect breathing
Describe common respiratory disorders

Study Tips

Trace air flow through the respiratory system
Draw diagrams of alveolar gas exchange
Understand pressure-volume relationships in breathing
Create tables comparing oxygen and carbon dioxide transport
Connect concepts to real-world breathing scenarios
