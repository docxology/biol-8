# Module 05: Membranes — Keys to Success

## Key Learning Objectives

### 1. Membrane Structure
- Describe the fluid mosaic model of membrane structure
- Identify the components of the plasma membrane (phospholipids, proteins, cholesterol, carbohydrates)
- Explain how the structure of phospholipids creates the lipid bilayer
- Understand membrane fluidity and factors that affect it

### 2. Membrane Proteins
- Distinguish between integral and peripheral proteins
- Describe the functions of membrane proteins (transport, enzymatic activity, signal transduction, cell recognition, intercellular joining, attachment)
- Explain how glycoproteins and glycolipids contribute to cell recognition

### 3. Passive Transport
- Define passive transport and explain why it requires no energy
- Describe simple diffusion and the factors that affect it
- Explain facilitated diffusion and the role of channel and carrier proteins
- Define osmosis and predict water movement based on solute concentrations

### 4. Tonicity and Osmotic Balance
- Define isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions
- Predict what happens to cells in different solution types
- Explain how organisms maintain water balance

### 5. Active Transport
- Distinguish between passive and active transport
- Describe how ATP powers the sodium-potassium pump
- Explain endocytosis and exocytosis (bulk transport)
- Compare phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis

## Study Tips

1. **Draw the fluid mosaic model** with all components labeled
2. **Create concentration gradient diagrams** for each transport type
3. **Practice predicting osmosis** in different scenarios
4. **Compare transport types** in tables
5. **Use animations** to visualize active transport mechanisms
