<h1>Module 04: Cellular Function — Study Questions</h1>
<h2>Cell Theory and Cell Types</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What are the three main principles of cell theory? Explain each principle in your own words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who were some of the scientists that contributed to the development of cell theory, and what were their contributions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the cell considered the basic unit of life? What characteristics do all cells share?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the main structural difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give two examples of organisms with prokaryotic cells and two examples with eukaryotic cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What structures do both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have in common?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cell Organelles and Functions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the function of the nucleus, and why is it called the "control center" of the cell?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do ribosomes differ from other organelles in terms of structure, and what is their essential function?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the functions of rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Why does the rough ER appear "rough" under a microscope?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the role of the Golgi apparatus in processing and packaging proteins? Where do proteins go after leaving the Golgi?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would happen to a cell if its lysosomes stopped functioning properly? Give specific examples of problems that could occur.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Energy and Metabolism</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the primary function of mitochondria, and why are they called the "powerhouses" of the cell?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the endosymbiotic theory and describe at least three pieces of evidence that support it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do plant cells have both mitochondria and chloroplasts? What is the relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Plant vs. Animal Cells</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What three structures are found in plant cells but NOT in typical animal cells? Describe the function of each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the cell wall provide advantages to plant cells that animal cells do not have?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the role of the central vacuole in plant cells? How does it differ from vacuoles in animal cells?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cytoskeleton and Cell Structure</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What are the three main components of the cytoskeleton, and what is the function of each?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do cilia and flagella differ in structure, number, and the type of movement they produce? Give an example of a cell that uses each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the cytoskeleton contribute to cell division? What specific structures are involved?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Challenge Questions (Optional)</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A cell is placed in a solution and you observe that the lysosomes begin to digest the cell's own organelles. What might be happening, and why would this occur?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were designing a cell to produce and secrete large amounts of protein (like an antibody-producing immune cell), which organelles would you expect to be most abundant? Explain your reasoning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
