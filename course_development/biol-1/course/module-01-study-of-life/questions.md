# Module 1: Biology - The Study of Life
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **The Characteristics of Life**
    *   List the seven characteristics shared by all living things.
    *   Select a specific organism (e.g., *E. coli*, a sunflower, a wolf) and explain how it demonstrates each characteristic.

2.  **Levels of Organization**
    *   Define each level of biological organization: Atom, Molecule, Organelle, Cell, Tissue, Organ, Organ System, Organism, Population, Community, Ecosystem, Biosphere.
    *   Which level is considered the fundamental unit of life? Justify your answer.

3.  **Classification Systems**
    *   What is the primary purpose of biological classification (taxonomy)?
    *   List the eight taxonomic ranks from most inclusive to most specific: Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.
    *   Explain the rules of Binomial Nomenclature. Why do scientists use scientific names rather than common names?

4.  **The Scientific Method**
    *   Outline the steps of the scientific method.
    *   Define homeostasis and provide a biological example.

### Part 2: Application
5.  **Energy Dynamics**
    *   Contrast how autotrophs and heterotrophs acquire energy.
    *   Diagram the one-way flow of energy through an ecosystem versus the cyclic flow of nutrients.

6.  **Evolutionary Pressures**
    *   **Scenario**: A beetle population contains green and brown individuals. Birds preferentially prey on the beetles.
    *   **Apply**: Predict how the presence of birds might shape the beetle population over generations if the environment is predominantly brown leaves.

7.  **Scientific Inquiry**
    *   **Scenario**: You observe that cellular phones lose battery faster in cold temperatures.
    *   **Design**: A controlled experiment including your observation, hypothesis, independent variable, dependent variable, and control group.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
8.  **Structure and Function**
    *   "Structure determines function" is a unifying theme in biology. Analyze this principle at the cellular level (e.g., red blood cells) and the organ level (e.g., the heart).

9.  **Theory vs. Law**
    *   Compare and contrast a scientific theory (e.g., Theory of Evolution) with a scientific law (e.g., Law of Thermodynamics). Which explains *why* phenomena occur?

10. **The Three Domains**
    *   Compare the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.
    *   Critique the statement: "All bacteria are harmful." Use evidence from biological diversity.
