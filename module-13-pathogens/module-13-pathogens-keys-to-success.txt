Module 13: Pathogens — Keys to Success

Key Learning Objectives

Introduction to Pathogens
Define pathogen and infectious disease
Identify the major categories of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, prions)
Explain how pathogens cause disease
Describe routes of transmission

Bacteria
Describe bacterial cell structure
Compare gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria
Explain how bacteria cause disease (toxins, tissue damage)
Describe beneficial bacteria and their roles
Understand antibiotic mechanisms and resistance

Viruses
Describe the structure of viruses
Explain why viruses are considered non-living
Describe the viral life cycle (lytic and lysogenic)
Explain how viruses cause disease
Understand antiviral treatments and vaccines

Fungi
Describe fungal cell structure
Identify common fungal infections
Explain how fungi are transmitted and cause disease
Understand antifungal treatments

Parasites and Prions
Distinguish between protozoan and helminth parasites
Describe common parasitic diseases
Explain what prions are and how they cause disease

Body Defenses Against Pathogens
Describe first-line defenses (skin, mucous membranes)
Explain the inflammatory response
Introduce the immune system's role in fighting infection

Study Tips

Create comparison charts for pathogen types
Study disease cycles with diagrams
Connect structure to pathogenesis
Learn key examples for each pathogen type
Relate concepts to public health and personal hygiene
