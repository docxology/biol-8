# Module 3: Organic Molecules
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **The Nature of Organic Molecules**
    *   What makes a molecule "organic"? Why is carbon the "backbone" of life?
    *   Define functional group and provide an example (e.g., hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl).

2.  **Building Blocks**
    *   Explain the relationship between monomers and polymers.
    *   Describe dehydration synthesis (releases water, builds polymers) and hydrolysis (uses water, breaks polymers).

3.  **The Four Classes of Biomolecules**
    *   Create a summary table comparing Carbohydrates, Lipids, Proteins, and Nucleic Acids. Include monomer names, key functions, and example molecules.

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Protein Folding**
    *   Protein function depends on its three-dimensional shape. Explain the four levels of protein structure:
        *   **Primary**: Linear amino acid sequence.
        *   **Secondary**: Alpha helices and beta pleated sheets (hydrogen bonding).
        *   **Tertiary**: 3D folding (R-group interactions, disulfide bridges).
        *   **Quaternary**: Multiple polypeptide subunits.
    *   **Apply**: What is denaturation? Why doesn't a cooked egg unfold when cooled?

5.  **Lipids and Health**
    *   Distinguish between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in terms of structure and physical state at room temperature.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Structure Determines Function**
    *   Cellulose and starch are both glucose polymers. Why can humans digest starch but not cellulose? Analyze the role of glycosidic linkage orientation.

7.  **ATP as Energy Currency**
    *   ATP is derived from a nucleotide. Explain where the energy is stored (phosphoanhydride bonds) and why ATP is called the "energy currency" of the cell.
