# Module 09: Inheritance — Keys to Success

## Key Learning Objectives

### 1. Mendelian Genetics Foundations
- Define gene, allele, genotype, and phenotype
- Distinguish between dominant and recessive alleles
- Explain homozygous and heterozygous conditions
- Describe Mendel's experiments and his two laws

### 2. Law of Segregation
- Explain the law of segregation
- Use Punnett squares to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes
- Calculate genotypic and phenotypic ratios for monohybrid crosses

### 3. Law of Independent Assortment
- Explain the law of independent assortment
- Perform dihybrid crosses using Punnett squares
- Understand when independent assortment applies and its limitations

### 4. Extensions to Mendelian Genetics
- Describe incomplete dominance and codominance
- Explain multiple alleles using ABO blood types as an example
- Understand polygenic inheritance and continuous variation
- Explain pleiotropy (one gene affecting multiple traits)

### 5. Sex Linkage and Chromosomal Inheritance
- Describe sex determination in humans
- Explain sex-linked inheritance patterns
- Predict outcomes of crosses involving X-linked traits
- Understand why sex-linked disorders are more common in males

### 6. Pedigree Analysis
- Interpret pedigree charts
- Determine modes of inheritance from pedigrees
- Identify carriers and affected individuals
