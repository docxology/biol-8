# Module 6: Metabolism
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Energy Basics**
    *   Differentiate between kinetic and potential energy using biological examples.
    *   State the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. How do living systems obey the second law while maintaining order?

2.  **Enzymes**
    *   What is activation energy? How do enzymes lower it?
    *   Explain competitive inhibition vs. non-competitive (allosteric) inhibition.

3.  **ATP Structure**
    *   Describe the structure of ATP. Which bonds contain the most energy (phosphoanhydride bonds)?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Metabolic Pathways**
    *   Compare anabolic (biosynthetic) and catabolic (degradative) pathways.
    *   Is photosynthesis anabolic or catabolic? Is cellular respiration anabolic or catabolic?

5.  **Enzyme Regulation**
    *   **Scenario**: Pepsin functions optimally at pH 2 (stomach).
    *   **Apply**: What happens to pepsin activity in the blood (pH 7.4)? Explain in terms of denaturation.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Redox Reactions**
    *   "OIL RIG": Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain (of electrons).
    *   In the reaction A⁻ + B → A + B⁻, identify which molecule is oxidized and which is reduced.

7.  **Feedback Inhibition**
    *   Explain feedback inhibition. Why is it efficient for the end-product of a pathway to inhibit the first enzyme?
