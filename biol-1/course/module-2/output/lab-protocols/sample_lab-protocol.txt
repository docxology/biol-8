Module 2 Lab: Cell Membrane Permeability

Objective

To investigate the permeability of cell membranes to different substances.

Background

Cell membranes are selectively permeable, allowing some substances to pass while blocking others. This property is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

Materials

Dialysis tubing
Starch solution
Iodine solution
Glucose solution
Glucose test strips
Beakers
Distilled water

Procedure

Part 1: Starch Permeability Test

Fill dialysis tubing with starch solution
Tie both ends securely
Place in beaker of iodine solution
Observe color changes over 30 minutes
Record observations

Part 2: Glucose Permeability Test

Fill dialysis tubing with glucose solution
Tie both ends securely
Place in beaker of distilled water
Test water for glucose at 0, 15, and 30 minutes
Record results

Data Collection

Create a data table showing:
Initial conditions
Observations at each time point
Final results
Conclusions about permeability

Analysis

Which substances passed through the membrane?
Which substances did not pass through?
What does this tell you about membrane selectivity?
How does this relate to real cell membranes?

Conclusion

Summarize your findings about membrane permeability and its biological significance.
