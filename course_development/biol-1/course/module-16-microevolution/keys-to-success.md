# Module 16: Evolution of Populations (Microevolution)
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Calculate** allele and genotype frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg equations.
2.  **Differentiate** between the effects of genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection on allele frequencies.
3.  **Identify** patterns of selection (stabilizing, directional, disruptive) from phenotypic data.
4.  **Explain** how heterozygote advantage maintains deleterious alleles in a population.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Gene Pool**: All alleles in a population.
- [ ] **Microevolution**: Changes in allele frequencies within a population over generations.
- [ ] **Sexual Dimorphism**: Phenotypic differences between males and females of a species.
- [ ] **Gene Flow**: Movement of alleles between populations via migration.
- [ ] **Bottleneck Effect**: A sharp reduction in genetic diversity following a population crash.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
*   **Question**: What are the five conditions for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
*   **Key Answer**: (1) No mutation, (2) No gene flow, (3) No natural selection, (4) Random mating, (5) Infinite population size. These conditions are rarely met; evolution is inevitable.

#### 2. Hardy-Weinberg Equations
*   **Question**: What are the two equations?
*   **Key Answer**:
    *   p + q = 1 (allele frequencies)
    *   p² + 2pq + q² = 1 (genotype frequencies)
    *   Start with q² (frequency of homozygous recessive) because this phenotype is identifiable.

#### 3. Genetic Drift
*   **Question**: What is genetic drift?
*   **Key Answer**: Random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events. Drift has a stronger effect on small populations due to sampling error.
