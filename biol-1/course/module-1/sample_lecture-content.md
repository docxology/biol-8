# Module 1: Introduction to Biology

## Overview

Biology is the scientific study of life. This module introduces fundamental concepts that form the foundation for understanding living organisms.

## Key Concepts

### Characteristics of Life

All living organisms share certain characteristics:

1. **Organization**: Living things are highly organized, from cells to organ systems
2. **Metabolism**: Living organisms carry out chemical reactions to obtain and use energy
3. **Homeostasis**: Living things maintain stable internal conditions
4. **Growth and Development**: Organisms grow and develop over time
5. **Reproduction**: Living things reproduce to create new individuals
6. **Response to Stimuli**: Organisms respond to changes in their environment
7. **Evolution**: Populations of organisms evolve over generations

### Levels of Biological Organization

Biological organization ranges from the smallest to the largest:

- **Atoms and Molecules**: Basic building blocks
- **Cells**: The fundamental unit of life
- **Tissues**: Groups of similar cells
- **Organs**: Structures made of multiple tissue types
- **Organ Systems**: Groups of organs working together
- **Organisms**: Individual living entities
- **Populations**: Groups of the same species
- **Communities**: Multiple populations interacting
- **Ecosystems**: Communities and their environment
- **Biosphere**: All life on Earth

## Scientific Method

Biology uses the scientific method to investigate natural phenomena:

1. **Observation**: Noticing something in nature
2. **Question**: Formulating a question about the observation
3. **Hypothesis**: Proposing a testable explanation
4. **Experiment**: Designing and conducting tests
5. **Analysis**: Examining the results
6. **Conclusion**: Drawing conclusions based on evidence

## Study Tips

- Review the characteristics of life regularly
- Understand the hierarchy of biological organization
- Practice applying the scientific method to real scenarios
- Connect concepts to everyday observations
