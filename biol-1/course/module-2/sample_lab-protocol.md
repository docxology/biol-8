# Module 2 Lab: Cell Membrane Permeability

## Objective

To investigate the permeability of cell membranes to different substances.

## Background

Cell membranes are selectively permeable, allowing some substances to pass while blocking others. This property is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis.

## Materials

- Dialysis tubing
- Starch solution
- Iodine solution
- Glucose solution
- Glucose test strips
- Beakers
- Distilled water

## Procedure

### Part 1: Starch Permeability Test

1. Fill dialysis tubing with starch solution
2. Tie both ends securely
3. Place in beaker of iodine solution
4. Observe color changes over 30 minutes
5. Record observations

### Part 2: Glucose Permeability Test

1. Fill dialysis tubing with glucose solution
2. Tie both ends securely
3. Place in beaker of distilled water
4. Test water for glucose at 0, 15, and 30 minutes
5. Record results

## Data Collection

Create a data table showing:
- Initial conditions
- Observations at each time point
- Final results
- Conclusions about permeability

## Analysis

1. Which substances passed through the membrane?
2. Which substances did not pass through?
3. What does this tell you about membrane selectivity?
4. How does this relate to real cell membranes?

## Conclusion

Summarize your findings about membrane permeability and its biological significance.
