Module 3: Climate Change and Ecosystems

Climate Change Overview

Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climate patterns. Current changes are primarily driven by human activities.

Greenhouse Effect

Natural Greenhouse Effect

Essential for life on Earth
Greenhouse gases trap heat
Maintains Earth's temperature

Enhanced Greenhouse Effect

Increased greenhouse gas concentrations
Primarily from human activities
Leading to global warming

Major Greenhouse Gases

Carbon Dioxide (CO2): From burning fossil fuels
Methane (CH4): From agriculture and waste
Nitrous Oxide (N2O): From agriculture and industry
Water Vapor: Natural but amplified by warming

Evidence of Climate Change

Temperature Records

Global average temperature increasing
More frequent heat waves
Warmer winters
Shifting temperature patterns

Ice and Snow

Melting glaciers
Reduced Arctic sea ice
Permafrost thawing
Earlier snowmelt

Sea Level Rise

Thermal expansion of seawater
Melting ice sheets
Coastal flooding
Saltwater intrusion

Extreme Weather

More intense storms
Changing precipitation patterns
Increased drought
More frequent wildfires

Impacts on Ecosystems

Terrestrial Ecosystems

Shifting species ranges
Changes in phenology (timing of events)
Altered growing seasons
Forest dieback
Desertification

Marine Ecosystems

Ocean acidification
Coral bleaching
Shifting fish distributions
Sea level rise impacts
Changes in ocean currents

Freshwater Ecosystems

Altered stream flows
Warmer water temperatures
Changes in species composition
Reduced water availability
Increased evaporation

Adaptation and Mitigation

Mitigation Strategies

Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Transition to renewable energy
Increase energy efficiency
Carbon capture and storage
Reforestation

Adaptation Strategies

Protect vulnerable ecosystems
Restore degraded habitats
Assist species migration
Develop climate-resilient practices
Plan for sea level rise

Future Projections

Climate Models

Predict future climate scenarios
Based on emission scenarios
Show range of possible outcomes
Help guide policy decisions

Potential Impacts

Continued temperature increase
More extreme weather events
Significant ecosystem changes
Economic and social impacts
Need for urgent action
