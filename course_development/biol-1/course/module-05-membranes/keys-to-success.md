# Module 5: Membranes
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Diagram** the structure of the plasma membrane according to the Fluid Mosaic Model.
2.  **Predict** the movement of water and solutes across a membrane under various osmotic conditions.
3.  **Compare** and **contrast** passive and active transport mechanisms.
4.  **Explain** how large molecules traverse the membrane via bulk transport (endocytosis/exocytosis).

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Amphipathic**: Having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions (characteristic of phospholipids).
- [ ] **Concentration Gradient**: The difference in solute concentration across a distance.
- [ ] **Aquaporin**: A channel protein that facilitates rapid water transport.
- [ ] **Turgor Pressure**: The pressure exerted by water pushing the plasma membrane against the cell wall in plant cells.
- [ ] **Ligand**: A molecule that binds specifically to a receptor protein.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Membrane Structure
*   **Question**: What are the three main components of the plasma membrane?
*   **Key Answer**: Phospholipids (bilayer barrier), proteins (transport, signaling, structure), and cholesterol (membrane fluidity regulation). Cholesterol prevents membrane rigidity in cold and excess fluidity in heat.

#### 2. Passive vs. Active Transport
*   **Question**: When is active transport necessary?
*   **Key Answer**: When solutes must move against their concentration gradient (low to high concentration). This requires ATP and transport proteins (e.g., Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase).

#### 3. Tonicity
*   **Question**: Define isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions.
*   **Key Answer**:
    *   **Hypertonic**: Higher solute concentration outside → water exits cell → cell shrinks (crenation in animal cells, plasmolysis in plant cells).
    *   **Hypotonic**: Lower solute concentration outside → water enters cell → cell swells (lysis in animal cells, turgidity in plant cells).
    *   **Isotonic**: Equal solute concentration → no net water movement.

#### 4. Bulk Transport
*   **Question**: How do large substances cross the membrane?
*   **Key Answer**: Endocytosis (phagocytosis, pinocytosis) brings material in; exocytosis releases material. Both require membrane flexibility and ATP.
