Module 2 Lab: Biodiversity Assessment

Objective

To measure and compare biodiversity in different habitats.

Background

Biodiversity can be quantified using various indices. This lab involves sampling different habitats and calculating biodiversity measures.

Materials

Quadrat frame (1m x 1m)
Field notebook
Plant identification guide
Calculator
Measuring tape

Safety

Be aware of surroundings
Watch for hazards
Do not disturb wildlife
Work in groups

Procedure

Part 1: Site Selection

Choose two different habitats (e.g., forest and grassland)
Mark study areas
Note habitat characteristics

Part 2: Sampling

Place quadrat randomly in each habitat
Identify all plant species within quadrat
Count individuals of each species
Repeat sampling 5 times per habitat
Record all data

Part 3: Data Analysis

Calculate species richness for each habitat
Calculate species evenness
Calculate Shannon Diversity Index
Compare habitats

Data Collection

Create tables showing:
Species found in each habitat
Abundance of each species
Total species counts
Diversity calculations

Calculations

Shannon Index

H = -Σ(pi × ln(pi))

Where:
pi = proportion of species i
ln = natural logarithm

Analysis Questions

Which habitat has higher biodiversity?
What factors might explain differences?
How do richness and evenness differ?
What are limitations of this method?

Conclusion

Summarize findings and explain what they tell us about biodiversity.
