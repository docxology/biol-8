Describe the structure of an atom (protons, neutrons, electrons)
Identify biologically important elements (C, H, O, N, P, S)
Explain the significance of atomic number and mass number
Define isotopes and their biological applications

Chemical Bonding
Differentiate between ionic, covalent, and hydrogen bonds
Explain how electronegativity influences bond formation
Describe polar vs. nonpolar covalent bonds
Understand the importance of weak bonds in biological systems

Properties of Water
Explain water's unique properties (cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat, solvent properties, density of ice)
Describe how hydrogen bonding creates these properties
Explain why water is essential for life

Acids, Bases, and pH
Define acids, bases, and the pH scale
Explain how buffers maintain pH stability
Describe the importance of pH in biological systems

Organic Chemistry Basics
Distinguish between organic and inorganic compounds
Identify the role of carbon in forming diverse molecules
Understand functional groups and their properties (hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, phosphate)
