# Module 4: Cells
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Cell Theory**
    *   State the three tenets of Cell Theory.
    *   Why is the cell considered the basic unit of life?

2.  **Cell Types**
    *   Create a Venn Diagram comparing prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
    *   Which domains of life are prokaryotic? Which are eukaryotic?

3.  **The Endomembrane System**
    *   Trace the path of a secretory protein from synthesis to export: Nucleus → Ribosome → Rough ER → Transport Vesicle → Golgi Apparatus → Secretory Vesicle → Plasma Membrane.

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Organelle Function**
    *   If a cell were a factory, what role would each organelle play?
        *   Mitochondria (Power Plant)
        *   Lysosome (Recycling Center)
        *   Nucleus (Control Center/CEO)
    *   Provide the biological justification for each analogy.

5.  **Plant vs. Animal Cells**
    *   You observe a cell with a rigid cell wall and green organelles under a microscope. Is this a plant or animal cell? Explain.
    *   Why do plant cells have a central vacuole while animal cells generally do not?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Surface Area to Volume Ratio**
    *   Analyze why cells must remain small. What happens to nutrient exchange efficiency as cell size increases?

7.  **Endosymbiotic Theory**
    *   Explain the Endosymbiotic Theory. What evidence suggests that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once independent prokaryotes?
        *   Double membranes
        *   Circular DNA
        *   70S ribosomes (similar to bacteria)
