# Module 1: Biology - The Study of Life
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Identify** and explain the seven fundamental characteristics shared by all living organisms.
2.  **Order** the levels of biological organization from atom to biosphere.
3.  **Differentiate** between the three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya) and the kingdoms within Eukarya.
4.  **Apply** the scientific method to hypothetical scenarios, distinguishing between hypothesis, theory, and law.
5.  **Explain** the flow of energy and cycling of nutrients in ecosystems.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Homeostasis**: The maintenance of stable internal conditions despite external changes.
- [ ] **Metabolism**: The sum of all chemical reactions in an organism, including anabolism (building) and catabolism (breaking down).
- [ ] **Binomial Nomenclature**: The two-part naming system for species (*Genus species*).
- [ ] **Prokaryote vs. Eukaryote**: Cells lacking a membrane-bound nucleus vs. cells with a true nucleus.
- [ ] **Autotroph vs. Heterotroph**: Organisms that produce their own food vs. organisms that consume others.
- [ ] **Natural Selection**: The differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to heritable variation.

### Concept Check
#### 1. The Characteristics of Life
*   **Question**: What are the 7 characteristics shared by all living organisms?
*   **Key Answer**: Organization, metabolism, homeostasis, growth and development, reproduction, response to stimuli, and evolution/adaptation.

#### 2. The Hierarchy of Life
*   **Question**: What are the levels of biological organization, from smallest to largest?
*   **Key Answer**: Atom → Molecule → Organelle → Cell → Tissue → Organ → Organ System → Organism → Population → Community → Ecosystem → Biosphere.
*   **Distinction**: A **Community** includes only the living organisms in an area, while an **Ecosystem** includes both living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) factors.

#### 3. Energy Flow and Nutrient Cycling
*   **Question**: How does energy flow through an ecosystem differ from nutrient cycling?
*   **Key Answer**: Energy flows one-way (Sun → Producers → Consumers → Heat). Nutrients cycle (Carbon, Nitrogen move between organisms and environment repeatedly).

#### 4. The Science of Biology
*   **Question**: What is the difference between a scientific theory and a scientific law?
*   **Key Answer**: A **Law** describes *what* happens under certain conditions (e.g., Law of Gravity). A **Theory** explains *why* phenomena occur, supported by extensive evidence (e.g., Theory of Evolution). Theories do not become laws; they serve different purposes.
