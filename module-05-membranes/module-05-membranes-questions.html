<h1>Module 05: Membranes — Study Questions</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Describe the fluid mosaic model of cell membrane structure. Why is it called "fluid" and "mosaic"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are phospholipids, and how does their structure make them ideal for forming cell membranes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do phospholipids spontaneously form a bilayer when placed in water?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What role does cholesterol play in the cell membrane?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between integral proteins and peripheral proteins?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name three functions that membrane proteins can perform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do glycoproteins on the cell surface help with cell recognition?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the plasma membrane described as "selectively permeable"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is passive transport, and why doesn't it require cellular energy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define diffusion and explain what determines which direction molecules will move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between simple diffusion and facilitated diffusion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is osmosis, and how is it different from other types of diffusion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic solutions.</p>

<p>What happens to a plant cell placed in a hypertonic saltwater solution?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the main difference between passive transport and active transport?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe how the sodium-potassium pump works and why it is important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between endocytosis and exocytosis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give an example of a cell that uses phagocytosis as part of its normal function.</p>
