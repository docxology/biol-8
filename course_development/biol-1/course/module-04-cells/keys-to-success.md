# Module 4: Cells
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Differentiate** between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells based on structure and complexity.
2.  **Identify** and describe the function of major eukaryotic organelles.
3.  **Trace** the production and transport of proteins through the endomembrane system.
4.  **Explain** the Endosymbiotic Theory regarding the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Cytoplasm**: The gel-like fluid filling the cell (cytosol + organelles).
- [ ] **Plasma Membrane**: The phospholipid bilayer that forms the cell boundary.
- [ ] **Organelle**: A membrane-bound, specialized structure within a eukaryotic cell.
- [ ] **Ribosome**: The site of protein synthesis (found in all cells; not membrane-bound).
- [ ] **Cytoskeleton**: A network of protein fibers (microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules) providing structure and movement.
- [ ] **ATP**: Adenosine triphosphate; the primary energy currency of the cell.

### Concept Check
#### 1. The Limits of Cell Size
*   **Question**: Why are cells microscopic?
*   **Key Answer**: As a cell grows, its volume increases faster than its surface area (SA:V ratio decreases). The membrane cannot supply nutrients or remove wastes efficiently for a large volume.

#### 2. Prokaryote vs. Eukaryote
*   **Question**: How do prokaryotic cells differ from eukaryotic cells?
*   **Key Answer**: Prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles. DNA resides in a nucleoid region. Prokaryotes (Bacteria, Archaea) are smaller and simpler than eukaryotes.

#### 3. Powering the Cell
*   **Question**: What is the role of mitochondria?
*   **Key Answer**: Mitochondria perform aerobic cellular respiration, converting glucose and oxygen into ATP. Cells with high energy demands (muscle, neurons) contain many mitochondria.

#### 4. The Endomembrane System
*   **Question**: What do lysosomes do?
*   **Key Answer**: Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down macromolecules, damaged organelles, and pathogens. Lysosomal rupture can trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death).
