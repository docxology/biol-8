</li>
<li>
<p>What are the primary functions of the cardiovascular system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it mean for humans to have a "closed" circulatory system?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between systemic circulation and pulmonary circulation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does the body need a circulatory system?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Heart Anatomy</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Name the four chambers of the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs? Which side pumps blood to the body?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the names of the four valves in the heart, and what prevents backflow of blood?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trace the path of blood through the heart, starting from the right atrium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the coronary circulation, and why is it important?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the three layers of the heart wall?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the left ventricle wall thicker than the right ventricle wall?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cardiac Cycle</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the cardiac cycle?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens during systole? What happens during diastole?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What causes the "lub-dub" heart sounds?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is cardiac output, and how is it calculated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What factors can increase or decrease cardiac output?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Electrical Conduction</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the SA node, and why is it called the "pacemaker" of the heart?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the path of electrical impulses through the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the role of the AV node?</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>What does an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) measure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the autonomic nervous system influence heart rate?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Blood Vessels</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What are the three main types of blood vessels?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do arteries have thicker walls than veins?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What structural feature helps veins return blood to the heart?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are capillaries important for nutrient and gas exchange?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does blood move from arteries to veins in the circulatory path?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is blood pressure, and how is it measured?</p>
</li>
<li>
