**BIOL-8: Human Biology** | College of the Redwoods, Del Norte Campus

---

## Learning Objectives & Goals

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Model mitosis** by physically moving paper chromosomes through each phase
- **Model meiosis I and II** by separating homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids
- **Trace alleles** through both types of cell division to see how they are distributed
- **Compare and contrast** mitosis and meiosis in terms of purpose, process, and outcomes
- **Demonstrate crossing over** and explain how it creates new allele combinations
- **Explain independent assortment** and its effect on genetic variation

---

## Introduction

Cell division is essential for life. **Mitosis** produces new cells for growth and repair, while **meiosis** produces gametes (sex cells) for reproduction. Although both processes involve dividing a cell's chromosomes, they differ in critical ways.

```
                        CELL DIVISION
                    ┌────────┴────────┐
                MITOSIS              MEIOSIS
            (for growth)         (for reproduction)
                 │                      │
           1 division            2 divisions
                 │                      │
         2 diploid cells        4 haploid cells
          (identical)           (genetically unique)
```

In this lab, you will use **paper chromosomes with labeled alleles** to physically walk through both mitosis and meiosis. By tracing specific alleles, you will see exactly how genetic information is distributed to daughter cells.

**Key Terms:**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Diploid (2n)** | A cell with two complete sets of chromosomes (one from each parent) |
| **Haploid (n)** | A cell with one set of chromosomes |
| **Homologous chromosomes** | Matching chromosome pairs (one maternal, one paternal) |
| **Sister chromatids** | Two identical copies of a chromosome, joined at the centromere |
| **Allele** | A version of a gene (e.g., A = dominant, a = recessive) |
| **Centromere** | The region where sister chromatids are joined |
| **Crossing over** | Exchange of DNA segments between homologous chromosomes |

## Materials

- Scissors
- Tape or glue stick
- **Chromosome Cutouts** (provided on the final page of this laboratory protocol)
  - Chromosome Pair 1: Gene A (alleles: **A** and **a**)
  - Chromosome Pair 2: Gene B (alleles: **B** and **b**)

## Setting Up Your Cell

### The Organism

We will model a simple organism with **2 pairs of chromosomes** (2n = 4):

```
    Chromosome Pair 1 (Gene A):
    ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
    │ Maternal  │     │ Paternal │
    │   (A)     │     │   (a)    │
    │  [RED]    │     │  [BLUE]  │
    └──────────┘     └──────────┘

    Chromosome Pair 2 (Gene B):
    ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
    │ Maternal  │     │ Paternal │
    │   (B)     │     │  (b)     │
    │  [RED]    │     │  [BLUE]  │
    └──────────┘     └──────────┘

    Genotype of starting cell: AaBb (diploid, 2n = 4)
```

### Procedure

1. **Cut out** the 4 single "Starting Cell" chromosomes from the final page of this lab.
2. Notice that maternal chromosomes are colored RED and paternal chromosomes are BLUE.
3. Draw a large circle on your blank paper to represent the cell membrane.
4. Place all 4 starting chromosomes inside this circle — this is your starting **diploid cell (2n = 4)**.
5. **Answer the "Setting Up Your Cell" questions on the final Worksheet page.**

## Part 1: Mitosis

### Step 1: S Phase (DNA Replication)

Before mitosis begins, DNA is copied during S phase.

1. **For each chromosome**, cut out its **identical copy** from the "S-Phase Duplicates" section of the final page.
2. **Join** each pair of identical copies using a small piece of tape at the center (the centromere) — these are now **sister chromatids**.
3. You should now have 4 duplicated chromosomes (8 chromatids total).

```
    After S Phase:
    ┌─────╥─────┐   ┌─────╥─────┐   ┌─────╥─────┐   ┌─────╥─────┐
    │  A  ║  A  │   │  a  ║  a  │   │  B  ║  B  │   │  b  ║  b  │
    │ RED ║ RED │   │BLUE ║BLUE │   │ RED ║ RED │   │BLUE ║BLUE │
    └─────╨─────┘   └─────╨─────┘   └─────╨─────┘   └─────╨─────┘
     (sister           (sister         (sister          (sister
     chromatids)      chromatids)     chromatids)      chromatids)
```

### Step 2: Prophase

1. Chromosomes are now visible as condensed, X-shaped structures (sister chromatids linked by centromere)
2. Arrange all 4 duplicated chromosomes loosely in the cell
3. **Note**: In mitosis, homologous chromosomes do NOT pair up

### Step 3: Metaphase

1. **Line up** all 4 duplicated chromosomes single-file along the middle of the cell (the metaphase plate)
2. Each chromosome lines up independently

### Step 4: Anaphase

1. **Separate the sister chromatids** — pull each pair apart at the centromere
2. Move one chromatid from each pair to one side of the cell, and the other chromatid to the other side
3. Each side should now have 4 chromatids (one A, one a, one B, one b)

### Step 5: Telophase & Cytokinesis

1. **Draw a line** down the middle of the cell to separate the two groups
2. Each group becomes a new daughter cell
3. Move each set of chromosomes into a newly drawn cell circle on your blank paper.
4. **Complete the "Part 1: Mitosis" tables and questions on the Worksheet.**

## Part 2: Meiosis I — Separating Homologous Chromosomes

### Reset Your Cell

1. Start with a fresh diploid cell (2n = 4) — same starting genotype: **AaBb**
2. Complete S phase: duplicate all 4 chromosomes into sister chromatids (same as in mitosis)

### Step 1: Prophase I — Synapsis and Crossing Over

This is the critical step that makes meiosis different from mitosis!

1. **Pair up homologous chromosomes** (synapsis):
   - Pair the A chromosome (red) with the a chromosome (blue)
   - Pair the B chromosome (red) with the b chromosome (blue)
   - Each pair is called a **tetrad** (4 chromatids in close contact)

2. **Simulate crossing over** on Chromosome Pair 1:
   - Take one chromatid from the A (red) chromosome and one chromatid from the a (blue) chromosome
   - **Cut a segment** from each and exchange the pieces
   - Tape the exchanged segments onto the opposite chromatid
   - You now have **recombinant chromatids** — one red chromatid with some blue, and one blue with some red

```
    Before Crossing Over:         After Crossing Over:
    ┌─────╥─────┐                 ┌─────╥─────┐
    │  A  ║  A  │  RED            │  A  ║  A* │  RED (A* = recombinant)
    └─────╨─────┘                 └─────╨─────┘
    ┌─────╥─────┐                 ┌─────╥─────┐
    │  a  ║  a  │  BLUE           │  a  ║  a* │  BLUE (a* = recombinant)
    └─────╨─────┘                 └─────╨─────┘
```

1. **Answer the Crossing Over question on the Worksheet.**

### Step 2: Metaphase I — Independent Assortment

1. **Line up the tetrads** (homologous pairs) along the middle of the cell
2. **IMPORTANT**: The orientation is random. There are two possible arrangements:

```
    Arrangement 1:              Arrangement 2:
    Left    │    Right          Left    │    Right
    A(red)  │  a(blue)          A(red)  │  a(blue)
    B(red)  │  b(blue)          b(blue) │  B(red)
```

1. **Choose one arrangement** — this is independent assortment in action!
2. **Answer the Independent Assortment questions on the Worksheet.**

### Step 3: Anaphase I

1. **Separate the homologous pairs** — pull each tetrad apart
2. Move ONE complete (duplicated) chromosome from each pair to each side
3. **Important**: Sister chromatids stay together! Only homologs separate.

### Step 4: Telophase I & Cytokinesis I

1. **Divide the cell** into two new cells
2. Each cell should have **2 duplicated chromosomes** (still sister chromatids joined)
3. Each cell is now **haploid** (n = 2), but chromosomes are still duplicated
4. **Complete the "Meiosis I Results" table on the Worksheet.**

---

## Part 3: Meiosis II — Separating Sister Chromatids

### For EACH of the Two Cells from Meiosis I

### Step 1: Metaphase II

1. Line up the duplicated chromosomes along the middle of each cell

### Step 2: Anaphase II

1. **Separate the sister chromatids** — pull each duplicated chromosome apart at the centromere
2. Move one chromatid to each side

### Step 3: Telophase II & Cytokinesis II

1. **Divide each cell** into two new cells
2. You should now have **4 total cells**, each with **2 single chromosomes** (one from each pair)
3. **Complete the "Part 3: Meiosis II" tables and questions on the Worksheet.**

## Part 4: Mitosis vs. Meiosis — Side-by-Side Comparison

Review your results and compare the purposes, processes, and outcomes of both cellular divisions.

**Complete the "Part 4: Comparison & Conclusions" tables and questions on the Worksheet.**

## Quick Reference

### Division Comparison

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis I | Meiosis II |
|---------|---------|-----------|------------|
| What lines up | Individual chromosomes | Homologous pairs (tetrads) | Individual chromosomes |
| What separates | Sister chromatids | Homologous chromosomes | Sister chromatids |
| Result | 2 diploid cells | 2 haploid cells (still duplicated) | 4 haploid cells |
| Genetic outcome | Identical | Varied (crossing over + assortment) | Varied |

### Sources of Genetic Variation

| Mechanism | When It Occurs | Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Crossing over | Prophase I | New allele combinations on chromosomes |
| Independent assortment | Metaphase I | Random mix of maternal/paternal chromosomes |
| Random fertilization | Conception | Any sperm can fuse with any egg |

**Connection to Module 08:** This lab directly applies the concepts of mitosis and meiosis from Module 08 (Cell Division). By physically tracing alleles through each stage, you can see how mitosis preserves genetic identity while meiosis creates genetic diversity — the raw material for inheritance (Module 09) and evolution.
