Module 03: Biomolecules — Keys to Success

Key Learning Objectives

Macromolecule Concepts
Define monomer, polymer, and macromolecule
Explain dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis reactions
Understand how building blocks combine to form larger molecules

Carbohydrates
Identify monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides
Describe the structure and function of glucose, sucrose, starch, glycogen, and cellulose
Explain the roles of carbohydrates in energy storage and structural support

Lipids
Describe the structure of fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and steroids
Differentiate between saturated and unsaturated fats
Explain the biological functions of lipids (energy storage, membrane structure, signaling)

Proteins
Identify amino acids as the building blocks of proteins
Describe the four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary)
Explain how protein structure relates to function
Understand protein denaturation

Nucleic Acids
Identify nucleotides as the building blocks of DNA and RNA
Describe the structure of DNA and RNA
Explain the roles of nucleic acids in storing and transmitting genetic information

Study Tips

Draw the structures of each macromolecule type
Create comparison tables for the four macromolecule classes
Practice identifying monomers from polymer examples
Use mnemonics to remember amino acid categories
Relate structure to function for each biomolecule type
