# Module 17: Speciation and Macroevolution
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Define** biological species and identify limitations of the concept.
2.  **Categorize** reproductive isolating mechanisms (pre-zygotic vs. post-zygotic).
3.  **Contrast** allopatric and sympatric speciation.
4.  **Explain** macroevolutionary patterns including adaptive radiation and convergent evolution.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Speciation**: The formation of new species.
- [ ] **Macroevolution**: Large-scale evolutionary changes occurring over long time periods.
- [ ] **Hybrid**: Offspring of two different species.
- [ ] **Polyploidy**: Having more than two complete sets of chromosomes; common mechanism of sympatric speciation in plants.
- [ ] **Analogous Traits**: Similar features that evolved independently (convergent evolution).

### Concept Check
#### 1. Biological Species Concept
*   **Question**: How is a species defined biologically?
*   **Key Answer**: A group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing viable, fertile offspring, reproductively isolated from other such groups.

#### 2. Reproductive Barriers
*   **Question**: What are pre-zygotic barriers?
*   **Key Answer**: Mechanisms that prevent mating or fertilization:
    *   Habitat isolation
    *   Temporal isolation
    *   Behavioral isolation
    *   Mechanical isolation
    *   Gametic isolation

#### 3. Modes of Speciation
*   **Question**: Compare allopatric and sympatric speciation.
*   **Key Answer**:
    *   **Allopatric**: Geographic barrier separates populations (most common).
    *   **Sympatric**: Speciation without geographic separation (e.g., polyploidy, habitat differentiation).
