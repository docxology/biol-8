## Part C: Short Answer Key

**49. Characteristics of living things (any 3):**

- Cellular organization (made of cells)
- Metabolism (use energy)
- Homeostasis (maintain internal stability)
- Growth and development
- Reproduction
- Response to stimuli
- Adaptation

---

**50. Ionic vs. Covalent bonds:**

- Ionic bonds: electrons are **transferred** from one atom to another, forming ions (charged particles) that attract each other
- Covalent bonds: electrons are **shared** between atoms
- Example: NaCl (ionic); H₂O (covalent)

---

**51. Four biomolecules:**

- **Carbohydrates** – quick energy (sugars, starches)
- **Lipids** – long-term energy, membranes
- **Proteins** – enzymes, structure, transport
- **Nucleic acids** – **store genetic information** (DNA and RNA)

---

**52. Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:**

| Feature | Prokaryotes | Eukaryotes |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Nucleus | No membrane-bound nucleus | Has nucleus |
| Organelles | No membrane-bound organelles | Has organelles (mitochondria, ER, etc.) |
| Size | Smaller (1-10 μm) | Larger (10-100 μm) |
| Examples | Bacteria, Archaea | Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists |

---

**53. Selective permeability and transport:**

The membrane is "selectively permeable" because it allows some substances through while blocking others. The phospholipid bilayer blocks large/charged molecules but allows small nonpolar molecules.

- **Passive transport example:** Diffusion of O₂ across the membrane (no energy)
- **Active transport example:** Sodium-potassium pump (uses ATP to move ions against their gradient)

---

**54. Aerobic respiration vs. fermentation:**

| | Aerobic Respiration | Fermentation |
|---|---------------------|--------------|
| Oxygen? | Yes | No |
| ATP yield | ~36-38 ATP per glucose | 2 ATP per glucose |
| Location | Cytoplasm + Mitochondria | Cytoplasm only |

Fermentation is less efficient because:

1. It only uses glycolysis (no Krebs cycle or electron transport chain)
2. Most energy remains in the waste products (lactic acid or ethanol)
