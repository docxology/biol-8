# Module 3 Study Guide: Genetics

## Essential Vocabulary

- **Genetics**: Study of heredity
- **Heredity**: Passing of traits from parents to offspring
- **Gene**: Unit of heredity
- **Allele**: Variant of a gene
- **Genotype**: Genetic composition
- **Phenotype**: Observable traits
- **Dominant**: Masking allele
- **Recessive**: Masked allele
- **Homozygous**: Same alleles
- **Heterozygous**: Different alleles
- **Punnett Square**: Tool for predicting inheritance

## Mendelian Principles

1. **Law of Segregation**: Alleles separate during gamete formation
2. **Law of Independent Assortment**: Genes assort independently

## DNA Basics

- Double helix structure
- Four nitrogenous bases
- Base pairing rules
- Role in inheritance

## Practice Problems

1. Cross a homozygous dominant (AA) with a heterozygous (Aa). What are the genotypic and phenotypic ratios?

2. In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant to short (t). Cross two heterozygous plants. What percentage will be tall?

3. Explain the difference between genotype and phenotype.

## Key Concepts

- How traits are inherited
- Predicting inheritance patterns
- DNA structure and function
- Chromosomal inheritance
- Genetic variation

## Study Tips

- Practice Punnett squares regularly
- Understand dominant vs. recessive
- Memorize genetic terminology
- Work through example problems
- Review DNA structure
