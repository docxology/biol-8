# Module 1: Ecology Fundamentals

## Introduction to Ecology

Ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and their environment. This module introduces fundamental ecological concepts.

## Levels of Ecological Organization

### Individual

A single organism responding to environmental conditions.

### Population

A group of individuals of the same species living in the same area.

### Community

Multiple populations of different species interacting in an area.

### Ecosystem

A community of organisms together with their physical environment.

### Biome

Large-scale ecosystems characterized by climate and vegetation.

### Biosphere

All life on Earth and the environments in which it exists.

## Abiotic and Biotic Factors

### Abiotic Factors

Non-living components of the environment:
- Temperature
- Water availability
- Sunlight
- Soil composition
- pH levels
- Wind patterns

### Biotic Factors

Living components of the environment:
- Predators
- Prey
- Competitors
- Symbionts
- Decomposers

## Energy Flow in Ecosystems

### Food Chains and Food Webs

- **Producers**: Autotrophs that capture energy (plants, algae)
- **Primary Consumers**: Herbivores that eat producers
- **Secondary Consumers**: Carnivores that eat primary consumers
- **Tertiary Consumers**: Top predators
- **Decomposers**: Break down dead organic matter

### Energy Pyramids

Energy decreases at each trophic level:
- Only about 10% of energy transfers between levels
- Most energy is lost as heat
- Limits the number of trophic levels

## Nutrient Cycles

Essential elements cycle through ecosystems:
- **Carbon Cycle**: Movement of carbon through atmosphere, organisms, and Earth
- **Nitrogen Cycle**: Conversion of nitrogen between forms
- **Water Cycle**: Movement of water through ecosystems
- **Phosphorus Cycle**: Movement of phosphorus through ecosystems

## Population Ecology

### Population Growth

- **Exponential Growth**: Unlimited growth under ideal conditions
- **Logistic Growth**: Growth limited by carrying capacity
- **Carrying Capacity**: Maximum population size an environment can support

### Population Regulation

- **Density-Dependent Factors**: Competition, predation, disease
- **Density-Independent Factors**: Weather, natural disasters
