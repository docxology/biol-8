# Module 7: Photosynthesis
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Trace** the flow of energy from sunlight to chemical bonds in glucose.
2.  **Locate** the reactions of photosynthesis within the chloroplast structure.
3.  **Explain** the inputs and outputs of the Light Reactions and the Calvin Cycle.
4.  **Differentiate** between C₃, C₄, and CAM photosynthetic strategies.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Photon**: A discrete packet of light energy.
- [ ] **Stomata**: Pores in leaves for gas exchange (CO₂ in, O₂ out).
- [ ] **Carbon Fixation**: The incorporation of atmospheric CO₂ into organic molecules.
- [ ] **NADP⁺/NADPH**: An electron carrier that transfers high-energy electrons in photosynthesis.
- [ ] **G3P (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate)**: The direct product of the Calvin Cycle; precursor to glucose.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Photolysis
*   **Question**: What happens in Photosystem II?
*   **Key Answer**: Water is split (photolysis), releasing electrons to the photosystem, H⁺ ions to the thylakoid lumen, and O₂ as a byproduct. This is the source of atmospheric oxygen.

#### 2. Carbon Fixation
*   **Question**: What does it mean to "fix" carbon?
*   **Key Answer**: Carbon fixation converts gaseous CO₂ into stable organic molecules. RuBisCO catalyzes the first step of the Calvin Cycle, attaching CO₂ to RuBP.

#### 3. C₃, C₄, and CAM Plants
*   **Question**: Why did C₄ and CAM pathways evolve?
*   **Key Answer**: In hot, dry conditions, C₃ plants lose efficiency due to photorespiration (RuBisCO binds O₂ instead of CO₂).
    *   **C₄ plants**: Spatially separate initial CO₂ capture (mesophyll) from Calvin Cycle (bundle sheath).
    *   **CAM plants**: Temporally separate CO₂ capture (stomata open at night) from fixation (day).
