# Module 8: Cellular Respiration
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **The Overview**
    *   Write the balanced equation for cellular respiration: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP.
    *   Name the four stages: Glycolysis, Pyruvate Oxidation, Citric Acid (Krebs) Cycle, Electron Transport Chain/Oxidative Phosphorylation.

2.  **Locations**
    *   Where does glycolysis occur?
    *   Where do pyruvate oxidation, the Citric Acid Cycle, and the ETC occur? (Be specific about mitochondrial compartments.)

3.  **Key Concepts**
    *   Define chemiosmosis and oxidative phosphorylation.
    *   What is the role of oxygen? Why is it called the "final electron acceptor"?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **ATP Accounting**
    *   Starting with one glucose molecule:
        *   Net ATP from glycolysis: 2
        *   ATP from Citric Acid Cycle: 2
        *   ATP from ETC/Oxidative Phosphorylation: 26-28
    *   Why is the total ATP yield a range (30-32) rather than a fixed number?

5.  **Anaerobic Options**
    *   If oxygen is unavailable, cells perform fermentation.
    *   Compare lactic acid fermentation (animals, bacteria) and alcohol fermentation (yeast).
    *   Does fermentation produce new ATP? What is its primary purpose?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Efficiency Analysis**
    *   Cellular respiration captures approximately 34% of glucose's energy in ATP. Where does the remaining energy go? (Heat, entropy)

7.  **Metabolic Integration**
    *   Proteins and fats can enter the respiratory pathway. Where do fatty acids enter? Where do amino acids enter after deamination?
