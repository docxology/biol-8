Module 2: Cell Biology

Introduction

Cells are the fundamental units of life. Understanding cell structure and function is essential for biology.

Cell Theory

The cell theory states:

All living things are composed of cells
Cells are the basic units of structure and function
New cells arise from existing cells

Cell Types

Prokaryotic Cells

Simpler structure
No membrane-bound organelles
DNA in nucleoid region
Examples: Bacteria, Archaea

Eukaryotic Cells

More complex structure
Membrane-bound organelles
DNA in nucleus
Examples: Plants, animals, fungi, protists

Cell Organelles

Nucleus

Contains genetic material (DNA)
Controls cell activities
Surrounded by nuclear envelope

Mitochondria

Powerhouse of the cell
Produces ATP through cellular respiration
Has its own DNA

Endoplasmic Reticulum

Rough ER: Protein synthesis
Smooth ER: Lipid synthesis and detoxification

Golgi Apparatus

Modifies, packages, and ships proteins
Works with ER to process cellular products

Ribosomes

Site of protein synthesis
Found free in cytoplasm or attached to ER

Cell Membrane

The cell membrane is selectively permeable and controls what enters and leaves the cell. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.

Transport Mechanisms

Diffusion: Movement from high to low concentration
Osmosis: Diffusion of water
Active Transport: Requires energy to move against gradient
Endocytosis: Bringing materials into cell
Exocytosis: Releasing materials from cell
