# Module 3 Lab: Genetic Crosses Simulation

## Objective

To simulate genetic crosses and observe inheritance patterns.

## Background

This lab uses coin flips to simulate the random nature of genetic inheritance, demonstrating Mendelian principles.

## Materials

- Two coins (representing alleles)
- Lab worksheet
- Calculator

## Procedure

### Part 1: Monohybrid Cross

1. Assign coin sides: Heads = dominant allele (A), Tails = recessive allele (a)
2. Flip two coins to represent parental gametes
3. Record the genotype of the "offspring"
4. Repeat 20 times
5. Calculate genotypic and phenotypic ratios

### Part 2: Dihybrid Cross

1. Use two coins for each gene (four coins total)
2. Flip all four coins simultaneously
3. Record genotype for both traits
4. Repeat 20 times
5. Analyze results

### Part 3: Data Analysis

1. Compare observed ratios to expected Mendelian ratios
2. Calculate chi-square values
3. Determine if results match expectations
4. Discuss sources of variation

## Data Tables

Create tables showing:
- Individual trial results
- Genotypic counts
- Phenotypic counts
- Expected vs. observed ratios

## Questions

1. How do your results compare to expected ratios?
2. What factors might cause variation?
3. Why is a larger sample size better?
4. How does this relate to real genetic inheritance?

## Conclusion

Summarize what you learned about inheritance patterns and probability in genetics.
