# Testing Rules

## Real Methods Policy

**All tests use real methods and implementations - no mocks, stubs, or fake methods.**

### Test Implementation
- All file operations use real file system operations
- All library calls use real library implementations (gTTS, weasyprint, etc.)
- All validation logic uses real validation functions
- All module operations use real module creation and validation

### External API Testing
- For external APIs (e.g., Canvas API), tests validate the logic and structure validation
- Tests verify that validation works correctly before API calls
- Actual API integration is tested in integration environments with real credentials
- Tests focus on the real validation and error handling logic

### Test Structure
- Use pytest fixtures for reusable test data
- Each test should be independent
- No shared state between tests
- Clean up test artifacts

### Test Quality
- Clear test names describing scenario
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Test real functionality, not mocked behavior
- Handle network failures gracefully when testing external services
