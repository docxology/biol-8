## Course Overview

A survey of human biology focusing on concepts in cell biology, genetics, anatomy, physiology, disease, and evolution as they relate to the human body. Students apply and evaluate these concepts in laboratory activities that include microscopy, experimentation, and dissection.

## Materials

- Concepts of Biology by OpenStax. <https://openstax.org/details/books/concepts-biology>
- Other materials will be provided through Canvas. <https://redwoods.instructure.com/>

## Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Use the scientific method to design experiments that include data collection and analysis.
2. Describe the structural, metabolic and reproductive characteristics of diverse cell types
related to human health, and explain how changes in cell function can be correlated with
disease.
3. Relate the structure and function of human organ systems to the maintenance of bodily
homeostasis.
4. Describe specific examples of the genetic basis of human anatomy, physiology, behavior and
disease, and explain how genetic variation impacts human evolution.

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Regular attendance is expected. Students are responsible for all material covered in class, even if absent. Communicate to the instructor if you will be absent.

### Assignments

- Assignments must be submitted by the specified due dates
- Late assignments may be accepted with instructor approval
- All work must be original and properly cited

### Laboratory Safety

- Follow all laboratory safety protocols
- Report any accidents or safety concerns immediately
- Proper use of equipment is required

### Academic Integrity

All work must be original. Plagiarism and academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and will result in appropriate disciplinary action.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI) policy

- It is 2026. AI is a tool that can be used to enhance learning.
- You may use AI to help you understand concepts, generate ideas, or improve your writing. We can discuss in class, various ways to use AI as a tool for learning.
- Where you do use AI, for assignments or otherwise, you must share how you used it. For example include the prompts that you used, the responses that you received, and subsequent edits you made -- not just a copied output. Showing the honest process of your work and learning will be recognized and rewarded. Merely copying outputs of AI without attribution is plagiarism and will be treated as such.
- Keep in mind that Exams in class will be pen-and-paper, without any computer or AI assistance.

## Module Schedule

The course progresses through modules sequentially. Each module builds upon previous concepts and prepares students for advanced topics.

Detailed schedules and due dates are provided in each module's materials.

## Communication

Questions and concerns should be directed to the instructor through appropriate channels as established for the course.
