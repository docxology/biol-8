# Module 08: Cell Division — Mitosis & Meiosis (OpenStax Chapter 6) — Keys to Success

## Key Learning Objectives

### 1. The Cell Cycle

- Describe the stages of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, M)
- Explain what happens during interphase (growth, DNA replication, preparation)
- Understand why cells need to divide (growth, repair, reproduction)
- Compare cell division in different cell types

### 2. Chromosome Structure

- Define chromatin, chromosomes, and chromatids
- Explain the structure of a duplicated chromosome (two sister chromatids joined at a centromere)
- Distinguish between diploid (2n) and haploid (n) cells
- Explain homologous chromosomes and how they differ from sister chromatids

### 3. Mitosis: Dividing for Growth and Repair

- Describe the events of each phase: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase (PMAT)
- Explain the role of the mitotic spindle in separating chromosomes
- Describe cytokinesis in plant cells (cell plate) vs. animal cells (cleavage furrow)
- State the result: **2 genetically identical diploid daughter cells**
- Explain the purpose of mitosis: growth, tissue repair, asexual reproduction

### 4. Meiosis I: Separating Homologous Chromosomes

- Explain why sexual reproduction requires meiosis
- Describe prophase I, including synapsis, tetrad formation, and crossing over
- Describe metaphase I (random alignment of homologs), anaphase I (homologs separate), telophase I
- State the result of meiosis I: **2 haploid cells, each with one chromosome from each homologous pair**

### 5. Meiosis II: Separating Sister Chromatids

- Explain that meiosis II resembles mitosis but starts with haploid cells
- Describe PMAT II stages
- State the final result: **4 genetically unique haploid cells (gametes)**

### 6. Mitosis vs. Meiosis — Key Comparisons

| Feature | Mitosis | Meiosis |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Purpose | Growth & repair | Gamete production |
| Number of divisions | 1 | 2 |
| Starting cell | Diploid (2n) | Diploid (2n) |
| Resulting cells | 2 diploid (2n) | 4 haploid (n) |
| Genetic outcome | Identical to parent | Genetically unique |
| Crossing over? | No | Yes (prophase I) |
| Where it occurs | Somatic cells | Gonads (ovaries, testes) |

### 7. Sources of Genetic Variation

- Explain crossing over and when it occurs (prophase I)
- Describe independent assortment (metaphase I) and calculate possible combinations (2ⁿ)
- Understand how random fertilization further increases variation
- Connect genetic variation to natural selection and evolution

### 8. Cell Cycle Regulation and Errors

- Describe the role of checkpoints in the cell cycle (G1, G2, M)
- Explain how cyclins and CDKs control the cell cycle
- Understand how uncontrolled cell division leads to cancer
- Define nondisjunction and its consequences (e.g., Down syndrome, Turner syndrome)

## Study Tips

1. **Use the mnemonic PMAT** to remember mitosis phases (Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase)
2. **Create side-by-side comparison charts** of mitosis and meiosis
3. **Draw and label each stage** — for both mitosis and meiosis I/II
4. **Use colored pencils** to track individual chromosomes and alleles through division
5. **Practice calculating** 2ⁿ combinations for independent assortment
6. **Watch animations** of cell division to see the dynamic movements of chromosomes
7. **Trace alleles** through an entire meiosis to see how genetic diversity arises
