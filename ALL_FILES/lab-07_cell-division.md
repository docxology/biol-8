## Introduction

Cell division is essential for life. **Mitosis** produces new cells for growth and repair, while **meiosis** produces gametes (sex cells) for reproduction. Although both processes involve dividing a cell's chromosomes, they differ in critical ways.

```
                        CELL DIVISION
                    ┌────────┴────────┐
                MITOSIS              MEIOSIS
            (for growth)         (for reproduction)
                 │                      │
           1 division            2 divisions
                 │                      │
         2 diploid cells        4 haploid cells
          (identical)           (genetically unique)
```

In this lab, you will use **paper chromosomes with labeled alleles** to physically walk through both mitosis and meiosis. By tracing specific alleles, you will see exactly how genetic information is distributed to daughter cells.

**Key Terms:**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Diploid (2n)** | A cell with two complete sets of chromosomes (one from each parent) |
| **Haploid (n)** | A cell with one set of chromosomes |
| **Homologous chromosomes** | Matching chromosome pairs (one maternal, one paternal) |
| **Sister chromatids** | Two identical copies of a chromosome, joined at the centromere |
| **Allele** | A version of a gene (e.g., A = dominant, a = recessive) |
| **Centromere** | The region where sister chromatids are joined |
| **Crossing over** | Exchange of DNA segments between homologous chromosomes |

---

## Materials

- Scissors
- Tape or glue stick
- Colored pencils or markers (at least 2 colors: one for maternal, one for paternal chromosomes)
- **Appendix A**: Printable chromosome cutouts — 2 pairs of homologous chromosomes
  - Chromosome Pair 1: Gene A (alleles: **A** and **a**)
  - Chromosome Pair 2: Gene B (alleles: **B** and **b**)
- **Appendix B**: Centromere connectors (small strips to join sister chromatids)
- **Appendix C**: Cell outline templates (circles representing cells)
- Blank paper or lab worksheet for staging chromosome movements

## Safety Considerations

- Use scissors carefully
- Keep workspace organized — small pieces can be easily lost

## Setting Up Your Cell

### The Organism

We will model a simple organism with **2 pairs of chromosomes** (2n = 4):

```
    Chromosome Pair 1 (Gene A):
    ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
    │ Maternal  │     │ Paternal │
    │   (A)     │     │   (a)    │
    │  [RED]    │     │  [BLUE]  │
    └──────────┘     └──────────┘

    Chromosome Pair 2 (Gene B):
    ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
    │ Maternal  │     │ Paternal │
    │   (B)     │     │  (b)     │
    │  [RED]    │     │  [BLUE]  │
    └──────────┘     └──────────┘

    Genotype of starting cell: AaBb (diploid, 2n = 4)
```

### Procedure

1. **Cut out** 4 single chromosomes from Appendix A
2. **Color** maternal chromosomes RED and paternal chromosomes BLUE
3. **Label** each chromosome clearly with its allele: A, a, B, or b
4. Place all 4 chromosomes inside a cell outline — this is your starting **diploid cell (2n = 4)**

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Record the genotype of your starting cell:**

{fill:text}

**How many chromosomes are in this cell?**

{fill:number}

**Is this cell diploid or haploid?**

## Part 1: Mitosis

> **Learning Goal:** Walk a diploid cell through all phases of mitosis and verify that both daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent.

### Step 1: S Phase (DNA Replication)

Before mitosis begins, DNA is copied during S phase.

1. **For each chromosome**, cut out an **identical copy** (same color, same allele)
2. **Join** each pair of identical copies with a centromere connector — these are now **sister chromatids**
3. You should now have 4 duplicated chromosomes (8 chromatids total)

```
    After S Phase:
    ┌─────╥─────┐   ┌─────╥─────┐   ┌─────╥─────┐   ┌─────╥─────┐
    │  A  ║  A  │   │  a  ║  a  │   │  B  ║  B  │   │  b  ║  b  │
    │ RED ║ RED │   │BLUE ║BLUE │   │ RED ║ RED │   │BLUE ║BLUE │
    └─────╨─────┘   └─────╨─────┘   └─────╨─────┘   └─────╨─────┘
     (sister           (sister         (sister          (sister
     chromatids)      chromatids)     chromatids)      chromatids)
```

### Step 2: Prophase

1. Chromosomes are now visible as condensed, X-shaped structures (sister chromatids linked by centromere)
2. Arrange all 4 duplicated chromosomes loosely in the cell
3. **Note**: In mitosis, homologous chromosomes do NOT pair up

### Step 3: Metaphase

1. **Line up** all 4 duplicated chromosomes single-file along the middle of the cell (the metaphase plate)
2. Each chromosome lines up independently

### Step 4: Anaphase

1. **Separate the sister chromatids** — pull each pair apart at the centromere
2. Move one chromatid from each pair to one side of the cell, and the other chromatid to the other side
3. Each side should now have 4 chromatids (one A, one a, one B, one b)

### Step 5: Telophase & Cytokinesis

1. **Draw a line** down the middle of the cell to separate the two groups
2. Each group becomes a new daughter cell
3. Place each set of chromosomes into a new cell outline

## Part 2: Meiosis I — Separating Homologous Chromosomes

> **Learning Goal:** Walk a diploid cell through meiosis I, including crossing over and independent assortment.

### Reset Your Cell

1. Start with a fresh diploid cell (2n = 4) — same starting genotype: **AaBb**
2. Complete S phase: duplicate all 4 chromosomes into sister chromatids (same as in mitosis)

### Step 1: Prophase I — Synapsis and Crossing Over

This is the critical step that makes meiosis different from mitosis!

1. **Pair up homologous chromosomes** (synapsis):
   - Pair the A chromosome (red) with the a chromosome (blue)
   - Pair the B chromosome (red) with the b chromosome (blue)
   - Each pair is called a **tetrad** (4 chromatids in close contact)

2. **Simulate crossing over** on Chromosome Pair 1:
   - Take one chromatid from the A (red) chromosome and one chromatid from the a (blue) chromosome
   - **Cut a segment** from each and exchange the pieces
   - Tape the exchanged segments onto the opposite chromatid
   - You now have **recombinant chromatids** — one red chromatid with some blue, and one blue with some red

```
    Before Crossing Over:         After Crossing Over:
    ┌─────╥─────┐                 ┌─────╥─────┐
    │  A  ║  A  │  RED            │  A  ║  A* │  RED (A* = recombinant)
    └─────╨─────┘                 └─────╨─────┘
    ┌─────╥─────┐                 ┌─────╥─────┐
    │  a  ║  a  │  BLUE           │  a  ║  a* │  BLUE (a* = recombinant)
    └─────╨─────┘                 └─────╨─────┘
```

<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Step 2: Metaphase I — Independent Assortment

1. **Line up the tetrads** (homologous pairs) along the middle of the cell
2. **IMPORTANT**: The orientation is random. There are two possible arrangements:

```
    Arrangement 1:              Arrangement 2:
    Left    │    Right          Left    │    Right
    A(red)  │  a(blue)          A(red)  │  a(blue)
    B(red)  │  b(blue)          b(blue) │  B(red)
```

1. **Choose one arrangement** — this is independent assortment in action!

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Which arrangement did you choose? (1 or 2)**

{fill:text}

**With 2 pairs of chromosomes, how many different arrangements are possible?**

{fill:number}

**With 23 pairs (human), the formula is 2ⁿ. How many possible arrangements?**

{fill:text}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Step 3: Anaphase I

1. **Separate the homologous pairs** — pull each tetrad apart
2. Move ONE complete (duplicated) chromosome from each pair to each side
3. **Important**: Sister chromatids stay together! Only homologs separate.

### Step 4: Telophase I & Cytokinesis I

1. **Divide the cell** into two new cells
2. Each cell should have **2 duplicated chromosomes** (still sister chromatids joined)
3. Each cell is now **haploid** (n = 2), but chromosomes are still duplicated

## Part 3: Meiosis II — Separating Sister Chromatids

> **Learning Goal:** Complete meiosis by separating sister chromatids in each haploid cell.

### For EACH of the Two Cells from Meiosis I

### Step 1: Metaphase II

1. Line up the duplicated chromosomes along the middle of each cell

### Step 2: Anaphase II

1. **Separate the sister chromatids** — pull each duplicated chromosome apart at the centromere
2. Move one chromatid to each side

### Step 3: Telophase II & Cytokinesis II

1. **Divide each cell** into two new cells
2. You should now have **4 total cells**, each with **2 single chromosomes** (one from each pair)

**Connection to Module 08:** This lab directly applies the concepts of mitosis and meiosis from Module 08 (Cell Division). By physically tracing alleles through each stage, you can see how mitosis preserves genetic identity while meiosis creates genetic diversity — the raw material for inheritance (Module 09) and evolution.
