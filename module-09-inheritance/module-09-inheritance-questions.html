<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between a gene and an allele?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define genotype and phenotype, and give an example of each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it mean for an allele to be dominant? Recessive?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the difference between homozygous and heterozygous?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who was Gregor Mendel, and why is he called the "father of genetics"?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the law of segregation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Mendel's experiments, a cross between two purple-flowered plants sometimes produced white-flowered offspring. How is this possible?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you cross two heterozygous tall plants (Tt × Tt), what are the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you set up a Punnett square for a monohybrid cross?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a cross between a homozygous dominant (BB) and homozygous recessive (bb) individual, what will be the genotype and phenotype of all offspring?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two heterozygous individuals (Aa × Aa) are crossed, what fraction of offspring would show the recessive phenotype?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the expected phenotypic ratio of a dihybrid cross between two individuals heterozygous for both traits?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is incomplete dominance? Give an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is codominance different from incomplete dominance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explain the inheritance of ABO blood types and describe what type of inheritance pattern it demonstrates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is sex determined in humans?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are sex-linked traits, and why are they more common in males?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a carrier woman (XᶜX) has children with a man with normal vision (XY), what is the probability their sons will be color blind?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a pedigree, and how is it used in genetics?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you tell from a pedigree if a trait is dominant or recessive?</p>
</li>
