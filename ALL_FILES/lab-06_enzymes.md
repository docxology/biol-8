## Introduction

Enzymes are biological catalysts — proteins that speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. Without enzymes, most biological reactions would occur too slowly to sustain life.

**Key Concepts:**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Enzyme** | Protein that catalyzes (speeds up) a specific reaction |
| **Substrate** | The molecule(s) that an enzyme acts upon |
| **Active Site** | The region of the enzyme where the substrate binds |
| **Product** | The molecule(s) produced by the reaction |
| **Catalyst** | A substance that speeds a reaction without being consumed |

**The Enzyme-Substrate Model:**

```
        SUBSTRATE                           PRODUCTS
           ▼                                   ▼
      ┌─────────┐                         ┌──┐  ┌──┐
      │    ●    │                         │● │  │● │
      └─────────┘                         └──┘  └──┘
           │                                   ▲
           ▼                                   │
    ┌──────────────┐                   ┌──────────────┐
    │   ENZYME     │        →          │   ENZYME     │
    │  ╭────────╮  │    catalysis      │  ╭────────╮  │
    │  │ Active │  │        →          │  │ Active │  │  (unchanged)
    │  │  Site  │  │                   │  │  Site  │  │
    │  ╰────────╯  │                   │  ╰────────╯  │
    └──────────────┘                   └──────────────┘
```

**Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity:**

1. **Temperature** — Enzymes have an optimal temperature; too hot denatures them
2. **pH** — Each enzyme has an optimal pH range
3. **Substrate concentration** — More substrate = faster reaction (until saturation)
4. **Enzyme concentration** — More enzyme = faster reaction
5. **Inhibitors** — Molecules that reduce enzyme activity

## Part 1: Catalase Activity

> **Learning Goal:** Observe enzyme activity and measure reaction rates using catalase.

### Background

**Catalase** is an enzyme found in nearly all living organisms. It breaks down hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), a toxic byproduct of cellular metabolism, into water and oxygen:

```
    2 H₂O₂  ――catalase――→  2 H₂O + O₂ ↑
    
    (hydrogen peroxide)    (water) (oxygen gas — bubbles!)
```

The production of oxygen gas (bubbles) provides a visible indicator of enzyme activity.

### Materials

- Fresh liver, potato, or yeast (source of catalase)
- 3% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)
- Test tubes
- Graduated cylinder
- Ruler
- Timer/stopwatch
- Safety goggles

### Procedure

1. Place a small piece of liver (or potato, or yeast suspension) in a test tube
2. Add 5 mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide
3. Immediately observe and time the reaction
4. Measure the **height of the foam/bubbles** produced after 30 seconds
5. Rate the reaction intensity (-, +, ++, +++)

### Baseline Observations

## Part 2: Effect of Temperature on Enzyme Activity

> **Learning Goal:** Investigate how temperature affects the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

### Background

Like all proteins, enzymes are sensitive to temperature:

- **Low temperature:** Molecules move slowly, fewer collisions, slow reaction
- **Optimal temperature:** Maximum enzyme activity
- **High temperature:** Enzyme denatures (loses shape), activity decreases or stops

Human enzymes typically work best around 37°C (body temperature).

### Procedure

1. Prepare 4 test tubes, each with equal amounts of enzyme source (liver)
2. Pre-incubate each tube at a different temperature for 5 minutes:
   - Ice bath (~5°C)
   - Room temperature (~20-25°C)
   - Warm water bath (~37°C)
   - Hot water bath (~60-80°C)
3. Add 5 mL of hydrogen peroxide (also pre-warmed to the same temperature)
4. Measure foam height at 30 seconds

## Part 3: Effect of pH on Enzyme Activity

> **Learning Goal:** Investigate how pH affects the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

### Background

Each enzyme has an **optimal pH** — the pH at which it works best. Extreme pH values can denature enzymes, just like extreme temperatures.

**Examples of Enzyme Optimal pH:**

| Enzyme | Location | Optimal pH |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Pepsin | Stomach | 1.5 - 2.0 |
| Catalase | Most cells | 7.0 - 7.5 |
| Trypsin | Small intestine | 7.5 - 8.5 |
| Lipase (pancreatic) | Small intestine | 8.0 |

### Procedure

1. Prepare 4 test tubes, each with equal amounts of enzyme source
2. Pre-treat each sample with a buffer of different pH for 2 minutes:
   - pH 2 (acidic)
   - pH 5 (slightly acidic)
   - pH 7 (neutral)
   - pH 10 (basic)
3. Add 5 mL of hydrogen peroxide
4. Measure foam height at 30 seconds

## Part 4: Effect of Substrate Concentration

> **Learning Goal:** Investigate how substrate concentration affects reaction rate.

### Background

As substrate concentration increases, the reaction rate increases — up to a point. When all enzyme active sites are occupied, the reaction rate reaches a maximum (**V_max**). Adding more substrate beyond this point will not increase the rate.

```
Rate of
Reaction
    │                      ●●●●●●●●●●●●●● V_max (saturated)
    │                  ●●●
    │              ●●●
    │           ●●
    │         ●
    │       ●

    │●
    └───────────────────────────────────
                                    Substrate Concentration
```

### Procedure

1. Prepare 4 test tubes with equal amounts of enzyme (liver)
2. Add different concentrations of H₂O₂:
   - 0.5% H₂O₂
   - 1.5% H₂O₂
   - 3.0% H₂O₂
   - 6.0% H₂O₂ (if available)
3. Measure foam height at 30 seconds

### Hypothesis

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Predict how increasing H₂O₂ concentration will affect reaction rate:**

| 0.5% | {fill:number} | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |
| 1.5% | {fill:number} | {fill:text} | {fill:text} |

| Substrate concentration | ↑ activity until saturation (V_max) |

**Connection to Module 06:** Enzymes are central to metabolism — every chemical reaction in your body is catalyzed by an enzyme. From digesting food (amylase, pepsin, lipase) to generating energy (ATP synthase) to building muscle (protein synthesis enzymes), understanding enzymes is essential for understanding how your body works. Enzyme disorders and enzyme-targeting drugs are major topics in medicine.
