# Module 10: Meiosis and Sexual Reproduction
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Contrast** the outcomes of asexual and sexual reproduction.
2.  **Distinguish** between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids.
3.  **Diagram** the phases of Meiosis I and Meiosis II.
4.  **Explain** the three sources of genetic variation: crossing over, independent assortment, and random fertilization.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Allele**: An alternative form of a gene at a specific locus.
- [ ] **Karyotype**: A display of an individual's chromosomes arranged by size and banding pattern.
- [ ] **Synapsis**: The pairing of homologous chromosomes during Prophase I.
- [ ] **Tetrad (Bivalent)**: The structure formed by two synapsed homologous chromosomes (four chromatids).
- [ ] **Euploidy**: Having the correct number of chromosomes.
- [ ] **Aneuploidy**: An abnormal chromosome number (e.g., trisomy, monosomy).

### Concept Check
#### 1. Meiosis I vs. Meiosis II
*   **Question**: What separates in Meiosis I? In Meiosis II?
*   **Key Answer**:
    *   **Meiosis I**: Homologous chromosomes separate (reductional division: 2n → n).
    *   **Meiosis II**: Sister chromatids separate (equational division: n → n).

#### 2. Genetic Variation
*   **Question**: Why is genetic variation important?
*   **Key Answer**: Variation provides raw material for natural selection. Genetically diverse populations are more resilient to environmental change and disease.

#### 3. Human Chromosomes
*   **Question**: How many chromosomes do humans have?
*   **Key Answer**: 46 total (23 pairs): 22 pairs of autosomes + 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX or XY). Gametes contain 23 chromosomes.

#### 4. Nondisjunction
*   **Question**: What is nondisjunction?
*   **Key Answer**: The failure of chromosomes or chromatids to separate properly during cell division, resulting in aneuploid gametes.
