<p>What prevents food from entering the trachea during swallowing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the structure of the trachea. What keeps it open?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens to the airways as they branch into smaller bronchi and bronchioles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are alveoli, and why are they important for gas exchange?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is surfactant, and why is it essential for lung function?</p>

</ol>
<h2>Mechanics of Breathing</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What muscles are involved in inspiration?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe what happens to the diaphragm and rib cage during inhalation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is normal exhalation active or passive? Explain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do pressure changes in the chest cavity cause air to move in and out of the lungs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is tidal volume?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is vital capacity, and how does it differ from total lung capacity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is residual volume, and why is it important?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Gas Exchange</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Where in the respiratory system does gas exchange occur?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What factors make alveoli efficient for gas exchange?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describe the process of gas exchange between alveolar air and blood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What determines the direction gases move during diffusion?</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>What is the most common form in which CO₂ is transported?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the release of CO₂ in the lungs relate to the release of oxygen to tissues?</p>
</li>
</ol>
