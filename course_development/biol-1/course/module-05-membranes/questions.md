# Module 5: Membranes
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Membrane Architecture**
    *   Describe the Fluid Mosaic Model. Why is the membrane described as "fluid"? What constitutes the "mosaic"?
    *   Sketch a phospholipid. Label the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails. Explain why phospholipids self-assemble into a bilayer in aqueous environments.

2.  **Permeability**
    *   Membranes are selectively permeable. List molecules that pass freely (small, nonpolar) and those that require transport proteins (large, polar, ions).

3.  **Transport Mechanisms**
    *   Define diffusion. Does it require energy?
    *   Define osmosis. In which direction does water move relative to solute concentration?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Tonicity**
    *   **Scenario**: Red blood cells are placed in three beakers:
        *   Beaker A: Pure distilled water.
        *   Beaker B: 0.9% saline (matches blood).
        *   Beaker C: 10% saline solution.
    *   **Apply**: Predict the outcome for cells in each beaker. Identify which solution is hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic.

5.  **Active Transport**
    *   Contrast passive transport (diffusion, facilitated diffusion) with active transport.
    *   The Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pumps 3 Na⁺ out and 2 K⁺ in per ATP hydrolyzed. Why does this require energy?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Bulk Transport**
    *   Distinguish endocytosis (phagocytosis, pinocytosis, receptor-mediated) from exocytosis.
    *   How do these processes depend on membrane fluidity?

7.  **Cell Signaling**
    *   Explain the role of receptor proteins and glycoproteins in cell communication. How does a cell "know" a hormone is present in the extracellular fluid?
