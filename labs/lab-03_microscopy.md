# Lab 3: Introduction to Light Microscopy

**BIOL-8: Human Biology** | College of the Redwoods, Del Norte Campus

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Identify and label the parts** of a compound light microscope
2. **Describe the function** of each microscope component
3. **Demonstrate proper microscope handling** and focusing techniques
4. **Calculate total magnification** using eyepiece and objective powers
5. **Observe and draw biological cells** at different magnifications
6. **Prepare wet mount slides** for microscopic observation

> **Connection to Human Biology:** The compound microscope is the foundational tool for studying cells and tissues. Every discovery about human anatomy—from the structure of blood cells to the organization of muscle fibers—began with careful microscopic observation. The skills you develop today will be essential for understanding how the human body works at the cellular level.

## Materials

- Compound light microscope (1 per student or pair)
- Prepared slides (cells, tissues)
- Blank glass slides and coverslips
- Lens paper
- Dropper bottle with water
- Optional specimens for wet mounts (newspaper, onion skin, cheek cells)

## Essential Rules for Microscopy

> **CRITICAL:** Following these rules protects expensive equipment and ensures successful observations.

### The Golden Rules

| Rule | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **1. Always start with the scanning objective (4×)** | Prevents lens damage and helps you find specimens quickly |
| **2. Never use coarse adjustment on high power** | The high-power objective is very close to the slide—coarse adjustment can crack the slide or damage the lens |
| **3. Lower the stage before switching objectives** | Prevents the new objective from hitting the slide |
| **4. Only use lens paper on objectives** | Paper towels and tissues scratch the lens coatings |
| **5. Always center the specimen before increasing magnification** | What you see at low power may not be visible at high power if it's not centered |
| **6. Carry the microscope with two hands** | One hand on the arm, one under the base—microscopes are expensive and delicate |

### Focusing Procedure (memorize this!)

1. **Start with 4× objective** (scanning power)
2. **Use coarse adjustment** to bring specimen into approximate focus
3. **Use fine adjustment** to sharpen the image
4. **Center** the part of the specimen you want to examine closely
5. **Switch to 10× objective** (low power)
6. **Use fine adjustment ONLY** to refocus
7. **Center again**, then switch to **40× objective** (high power)
8. **Use fine adjustment ONLY** to refocus

## Part 1: Microscope Anatomy & Labeling

> **Learning Goal:** Become familiar with the parts of a compound light microscope and their functions.

Using the microscope at your station, examine its parts carefully. In the large box below, **draw your microscope** and label it using the terms from the list.

<!-- lab:drawing-area title="Microscope Drawing" height=500 -->

**Draw your compound light microscope here:**

{fill:drawing height=450}

<!-- /lab:drawing-area -->

### Terms to Label on Your Drawing

Use the following terms to label your drawing. Draw lines from each part to its label on your diagram.

| Term | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Eyepiece (Ocular Lens)** | Lens you look through; typically 10× magnification |
| **Objective Lenses** | Rotating lenses providing different magnifications (4×, 10×, 40×) |
| **Revolving Nosepiece** | Rotates to change objective lenses |
| **Stage** | Platform where the slide is placed |
| **Stage Clips** | Hold the slide in place on the stage |
| **Coarse Adjustment Knob** | Large knob for rough focusing (use only with low power) |
| **Fine Adjustment Knob** | Small knob for precise focusing |
| **Diaphragm/Iris** | Controls the amount of light passing through specimen |
| **Light Source** | Illuminates the specimen from below |
| **Arm** | Used to carry the microscope; connects body to base |
| **Base** | Bottom support of the microscope |

## Part 3: Making and Observing Your Own Slide

> **Learning Goal:** Learn to prepare slides and explore specimens of your choosing. Depending on your specimen, you may prepare a **wet mount** (for biological specimens) or a **dry mount** (for paper, fabric, or other small objects).

### Slide Preparation Options

**Wet Mount** (for biological specimens like onion skin, cheek cells, pond water):

1. Place a **clean glass slide** on a flat surface
2. Add **ONE small drop of water** to the center of the slide
3. Place the specimen **in the water drop**
4. Hold a coverslip at a **45° angle**, touching one edge to the water
5. **Slowly lower** the coverslip to avoid trapping air bubbles
6. Blot excess water with a paper towel if needed

**Dry Mount** (for paper, fabric, hair, or other non-biological specimens):

1. Place a **clean glass slide** on a flat surface
2. Place your specimen **directly on the slide** (no water needed)
3. Carefully place a coverslip on top

**Tip:** If you see large circular objects that are all the same size, those are likely air bubbles, not cells!

## Quick Reference Card

### Magnification Formula

**Total Magnification = Eyepiece Power × Objective Power**

### Common Objective Lens Colors

| Objective | Color Band | Magnification | When to Use |
|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| Scanning | Red | 4× | Finding specimens, initial viewing |
| Low Power | Yellow | 10× | Getting the full picture |
| High Power | Blue | 40× | Seeing cellular detail |

### The Focusing Mantra

**"Start LOW, go SLOW, FINE at 4-0"**

- Start with the **LOW**est power objective
- Go **SLOW**ly when adjusting focus
- Only use **FINE** adjustment at **40**× (high power)

> **Looking Ahead:** The microscopy skills you learned today will be applied throughout this course. In upcoming labs, you will use the microscope to examine specific human tissues—epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissue—and understand how their cellular structure relates to their function in the human body.
