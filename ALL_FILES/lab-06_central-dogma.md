## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Model DNA replication** by drawing complementary strands.
- **Perform transcription** by converting a DNA template strand into an mRNA sequence.
- **Perform translation** by decoding mRNA codons into an amino acid chain.
- **Trace the flow of genetic information** from DNA → RNA → Protein (the Central Dogma).
- **Use a codon table** to identify amino acids.
- **Simulate a mutation** and observe its effect on the final protein.

## Introduction

The **Central Dogma of Molecular Biology** describes the flow of genetic information:

**DNA** (Nucleus) —> **mRNA** (Nucleus → Cytoplasm) —> **PROTEIN** (Ribosome)

In this lab, we will use a **digital dashboard** to simulate these processes step-by-step as a class, while you **draw and record** the results on this worksheet.

**Key Terms:**

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Nucleotide** | Building block of DNA/RNA (base + sugar + phosphate) |
| **Complementary base pairing** | A pairs with T (DNA) or U (RNA); G pairs with C |
| **Codon** | Three-nucleotide sequence on mRNA that codes for an amino acid |
| **Start codon** | AUG — signals the beginning of translation (Methionine) |
| **Stop codon** | UAA, UAG, UGA — signals the end of translation |

## Part 1: DNA Replication

> **Dashboard Tool:** Go to **Part 1: DNA Replication**.

### Background

Before a cell divides, it must copy its DNA. **Helicase** unzips the strands, and **DNA Polymerase** builds new ones.

### Procedure

1. On the dashboard, you will see a **Template Strand**.
2. Use the buttons to build the complementary **New Strand**.
3. Once verified on the screen, **draw/write** the sequence below.

**Template Strand (3' to 5'):**
`T  A  C     A  A  G     T  T  T     G  C  A     C  C  G     A  T  T`

**Complementary New Strand (5' to 3'):**

## Part 2: Transcription — DNA → mRNA

> **Dashboard Tool:** Click **Next: Transcription**.

### Background

**RNA Polymerase** reads the DNA template and builds a single-stranded **mRNA** message to send to the ribosome. Remember: **RNA uses Uracil (U)** instead of Thymine (T).

### Procedure

1. The dashboard shows the same gene's DNA template.
2. Transcribe it into mRNA using the on-screen tools.
3. **Record** your mRNA sequence below. By convention, write mRNA 5' to 3'.

**DNA Template:** `TAC AAG TTT GCA CCG ATT`

**mRNA Sequence:**
5'— {fill:text} —3'

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**3. Where in the cell does transcription occur?**

{fill:text}

**4. Compare your mRNA sequence to the "New Strand" of DNA you wrote in Part 1. What is the observable difference?**

## Part 3: Translation — mRNA → Protein

> **Dashboard Tool:** Click **Next: Translation**.

### Background

The ribosome reads mRNA in triplets called **codons**. **tRNA** molecules bring the matching amino acids.

### Procedure

1. The dashboard displays your mRNA sequence.
2. Use the on-screen **Codon Table** to find the amino acid for each triplet.
3. Click the amino acid buttons to build the protein chain.
4. **Write** the final amino acid sequence below.

**Polypeptide Chain (Protein):**

{fill:text} — {fill:text} — {fill:text} — {fill:text} — {fill:text} — {fill:text}

*(Note: If you encounter a STOP codon, write "STOP" and do not add more amino acids)*

**5. What is the start postion (codon)?**

{fill:text}

**6. What amino acid does the start codon (AUG) always code for?**

## Part 4: Mutation Simulation

> **Dashboard Tool:** Click **Part 4: Mutation Builder**.

### Procedure

1. Change the **4th Codon** of the original DNA Sequence.
    - Original DNA: `GCA` (codes for Arg in mRNA -> CGU) -> *Wait, let's check the dashboard logic.*
    - *Correction*: DNA `GCA` -> mRNA `CGU` -> AA `Arg`.
2. In the dashboard mutation tool, change the DNA base **C** to **T** in that codon (so it becomes `GTA`).
3. Observe how the mRNA and Protein change.

**Original DNA Codon:** `GCA` -> **Amino Acid:** Arginine (Arg)

**Mutated DNA Codon:** `GTA`

**New mRNA Codon:** {fill:text}

**New Amino Acid:** {fill:text}

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**7. Did this mutation change the protein structure?**

{fill:text}

**8. This type of mutation (changing one base) is called a:**
A) Frameshift
B) Deletion
C) Point Mutation (Substitution)
