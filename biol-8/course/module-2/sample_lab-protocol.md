# Module 2 Lab: Biodiversity Assessment

## Objective

To measure and compare biodiversity in different habitats.

## Background

Biodiversity can be quantified using various indices. This lab involves sampling different habitats and calculating biodiversity measures.

## Materials

- Quadrat frame (1m x 1m)
- Field notebook
- Plant identification guide
- Calculator
- Measuring tape

## Safety

- Be aware of surroundings
- Watch for hazards
- Do not disturb wildlife
- Work in groups

## Procedure

### Part 1: Site Selection

1. Choose two different habitats (e.g., forest and grassland)
2. Mark study areas
3. Note habitat characteristics

### Part 2: Sampling

1. Place quadrat randomly in each habitat
2. Identify all plant species within quadrat
3. Count individuals of each species
4. Repeat sampling 5 times per habitat
5. Record all data

### Part 3: Data Analysis

1. Calculate species richness for each habitat
2. Calculate species evenness
3. Calculate Shannon Diversity Index
4. Compare habitats

## Data Collection

Create tables showing:
- Species found in each habitat
- Abundance of each species
- Total species counts
- Diversity calculations

## Calculations

### Shannon Index

H = -Σ(pi × ln(pi))

Where:
- pi = proportion of species i
- ln = natural logarithm

## Analysis Questions

1. Which habitat has higher biodiversity?
2. What factors might explain differences?
3. How do richness and evenness differ?
4. What are limitations of this method?

## Conclusion

Summarize findings and explain what they tell us about biodiversity.
