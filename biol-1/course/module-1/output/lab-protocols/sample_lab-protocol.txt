Module 1 Lab: Introduction to Microscopy

Objective

To learn proper use of the compound light microscope and observe basic cell structures.

Materials

Compound light microscope
Prepared slides of plant and animal cells
Lens paper
Microscope slides and coverslips

Safety

Handle microscopes carefully
Use both hands when carrying microscopes
Clean lenses only with lens paper
Report any damage immediately

Procedure

Part 1: Microscope Setup

Place microscope on stable surface
Plug in and turn on light source
Start with lowest magnification objective (4x)
Adjust light intensity using diaphragm

Part 2: Observing Prepared Slides

Place slide on stage and secure with stage clips
Use coarse focus to bring specimen into view
Use fine focus for sharp image
Switch to higher magnifications as needed
Draw observations in lab notebook

Part 3: Observations

Record observations for:
Plant cell structure
Animal cell structure
Differences between cell types
Organelles visible at different magnifications

Data Collection

Create labeled drawings of:
Plant cell at 100x magnification
Animal cell at 100x magnification
Comparison table of structures observed

Analysis Questions

What structures were visible in plant cells but not animal cells?
How did image quality change with magnification?
What is the function of the cell structures you observed?

Conclusion

Summarize what you learned about cell structure and microscopy techniques.
