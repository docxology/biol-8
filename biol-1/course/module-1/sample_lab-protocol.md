# Module 1 Lab: Introduction to Microscopy

## Objective

To learn proper use of the compound light microscope and observe basic cell structures.

## Materials

- Compound light microscope
- Prepared slides of plant and animal cells
- Lens paper
- Microscope slides and coverslips

## Safety

- Handle microscopes carefully
- Use both hands when carrying microscopes
- Clean lenses only with lens paper
- Report any damage immediately

## Procedure

### Part 1: Microscope Setup

1. Place microscope on stable surface
2. Plug in and turn on light source
3. Start with lowest magnification objective (4x)
4. Adjust light intensity using diaphragm

### Part 2: Observing Prepared Slides

1. Place slide on stage and secure with stage clips
2. Use coarse focus to bring specimen into view
3. Use fine focus for sharp image
4. Switch to higher magnifications as needed
5. Draw observations in lab notebook

### Part 3: Observations

Record observations for:
- Plant cell structure
- Animal cell structure
- Differences between cell types
- Organelles visible at different magnifications

## Data Collection

Create labeled drawings of:
- Plant cell at 100x magnification
- Animal cell at 100x magnification
- Comparison table of structures observed

## Analysis Questions

1. What structures were visible in plant cells but not animal cells?
2. How did image quality change with magnification?
3. What is the function of the cell structures you observed?

## Conclusion

Summarize what you learned about cell structure and microscopy techniques.
