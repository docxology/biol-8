# Module 14: Biotechnology and Genomics
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **The Toolbox**
    *   What is a restriction enzyme? How do "sticky ends" facilitate ligation?
    *   What is a vector (e.g., plasmid)? How is it used to introduce foreign DNA into bacteria?

2.  **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)**
    *   Describe the three steps of PCR: Denaturation, Annealing, Extension.
    *   Why is PCR called "molecular photocopying"? Why is it useful for forensics?

3.  **Visualizing DNA**
    *   Explain how gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments.
    *   Do smaller fragments migrate faster or slower? Why?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Genetic Engineering**
    *   Define transgenic organism (GMO).
    *   Outline the steps to produce insulin-secreting bacteria.

5.  **DNA Fingerprinting**
    *   In a paternity test, a child has bands at positions A and B. The mother has band A.
    *   Must the biological father have band B? Explain.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Gene Therapy**
    *   Differentiate ex vivo (cells treated outside the body) and in vivo (treatment inside the body) gene therapy.
    *   What are the major challenges? (Delivery, immune response, targeting)

7.  **Genomics**
    *   We have sequenced the human genome. Why doesn't knowing the sequence immediately reveal gene function?
    *   What is functional genomics?
