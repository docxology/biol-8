# Module 2: Basic Chemistry
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Atomic Structure**
    *   Identify the three subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, electrons). Describe their location, relative mass, and charge.
    *   What determines the identity of an element?

2.  **Chemical Bonding**
    *   Define the Octet Rule. Why do atoms form bonds?
    *   Differentiate between ionic bonds, covalent bonds (polar and non-polar), and hydrogen bonds.

3.  **Properties of Water**
    *   Explain why water is a polar molecule. How does polarity lead to hydrogen bonding?
    *   List four properties of water critical for life: cohesion, adhesion, high specific heat, solvent properties.

### Part 2: Application
4.  **pH and Buffers**
    *   The pH scale is logarithmic. How much more acidic is a solution with pH 3 compared to pH 6?
    *   Explain the role of buffers in biological systems. What happens if blood pH shifts from 7.4 to 6.8?

5.  **Isotopes in Biology**
    *   **Scenario**: A paleontologist discovers a fossil and wants to determine its age.
    *   **Apply**: Explain how radioactive isotopes (e.g., Carbon-14) and half-life calculations are used in radiometric dating.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Reactivity and Stability**
    *   Analyze the relationship between electron configuration and chemical reactivity.
    *   Why are noble gases (He, Ne, Ar) largely unreactive?

7.  **Water in Ecosystems**
    *   Ice floats because solid water is less dense than liquid water.
    *   Analyze how this property affects aquatic ecosystems in winter. What would happen if ice sank?
