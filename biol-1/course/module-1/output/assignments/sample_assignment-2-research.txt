Assignment 2: Research on Cell Types

Objective

Research and compare different types of cells found in living organisms.

Instructions

Choose two different cell types (e.g., plant cell and animal cell, or prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell) and create a comprehensive comparison.

Requirements

Cell Structure Comparison (30 points)

Create a detailed comparison table including:

Organelles present
Size range
Shape characteristics
Specialized functions

Visual Representation (25 points)

Include labeled diagrams of both cell types showing:
Major organelles
Structural differences
Scale indicators

Function Analysis (25 points)

Explain how the structure of each cell type relates to its function. Include:
How organelles support cell function
Adaptations for specific roles
Examples of where these cells are found

Research Summary (20 points)

Key similarities between the cell types
Important differences
Why these differences exist
Significance of cell diversity
