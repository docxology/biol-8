# Module 3: Organic Molecules
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Classify** the four major groups of biological macromolecules and identify their constituent monomers.
2.  **Explain** the chemical reactions (dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis) that build and break polymers.
3.  **Correlate** the structural levels of proteins with their specific functions and vulnerability to denaturation.
4.  **Differentiate** between DNA, RNA, and ATP in terms of structure and function.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Macromolecule**: A large organic molecule formed by the polymerization of smaller subunits (monomers).
- [ ] **Hydrophobic**: Repelling water; characteristic of non-polar molecules like lipids.
- [ ] **Peptide Bond**: The covalent bond linking two amino acids together.
- [ ] **Nucleotide**: The monomer of nucleic acids, composed of a sugar, phosphate group, and nitrogenous base.
- [ ] **Enzyme**: A protein catalyst that accelerates biochemical reactions.
- [ ] **Phospholipid**: An amphipathic lipid with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails; the structural basis of cell membranes.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Carbohydrates
*   **Question**: What is the primary function of carbohydrates?
*   **Key Answer**: Energy storage (starch, glycogen) and structural support (cellulose, chitin).
*   **Distinction**: Storage polysaccharides (glycogen) are branched for rapid glucose release; structural polysaccharides (cellulose) form linear, rigid fibers.

#### 2. Lipids
*   **Question**: What defines a lipid?
*   **Key Answer**: Lipids are hydrophobic or amphipathic molecules including fats, phospholipids, and steroids. They share insolubility in water, not structural similarity.

#### 3. Proteins
*   **Question**: What roles do proteins serve?
*   **Key Answer**: Enzymes, structural components, transport carriers, antibodies, hormones, and motor proteins. A single amino acid change (e.g., sickle cell mutation) can disrupt protein folding and function.

#### 4. Nucleic Acids
*   **Question**: How do the two strands of DNA remain associated?
*   **Key Answer**: Complementary base pairing via hydrogen bonds: Adenine-Thymine (2 bonds) and Guanine-Cytosine (3 bonds). This follows Chargaff's Rules: %A = %T and %G = %C.
