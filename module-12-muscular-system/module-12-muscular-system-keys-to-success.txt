Module 12: Muscular System — Keys to Success

Key Learning Objectives

Functions of the Muscular System
Describe the major functions (movement, posture, heat production, protection)
Explain how muscles contribute to body temperature regulation
Understand the role of muscles in stabilizing joints

Skeletal Muscle Structure
Describe the organization of skeletal muscle (fascicles, fibers, myofibrils, sarcomeres)
Identify the components of a sarcomere (thick and thin filaments, Z-lines, A-band, I-band)
Explain the relationship between muscle structure and function
Describe the connective tissue layers (epimysium, perimysium, endomysium)

Sliding Filament Theory
Describe the sliding filament model of muscle contraction
Explain the roles of actin, myosin, troponin, and tropomyosin
Describe the cross-bridge cycle
Explain why ATP and calcium are essential for contraction

Neuromuscular Junction
Describe the structure of a neuromuscular junction
Explain how an action potential triggers muscle contraction
Describe the role of acetylcholine in muscle activation
Understand excitation-contraction coupling

Muscle Mechanics
Define motor unit and explain recruitment
Differentiate between twitch, summation, and tetanus
Compare isotonic and isometric contractions
Explain muscle fatigue and its causes

Muscle Fiber Types
Compare slow-twitch (Type I) and fast-twitch (Type II) fibers
Explain how fiber type relates to muscle function
Understand how training affects muscle fiber characteristics

Study Tips

Draw and label sarcomere diagrams
Animate the cross-bridge cycle in your mind
Use models to visualize muscle organization
Connect physiology to practical examples (exercise, fatigue)
Compare contraction types with real-world movements
