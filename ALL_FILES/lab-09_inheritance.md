## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Define key genetics terms: gene, allele, genotype, phenotype, dominant, recessive
- Use Punnett squares to predict offspring genotypes and phenotypes
- Analyze a family pedigree to trace inheritance of a trait

---

## Part 1: Key Concepts

Read each term and definition carefully. You will use these throughout the entire lab.

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Gene** | A segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait |
| **Allele** | A version of a gene (e.g., brown-eye allele vs. blue-eye allele) |
| **Diploid** | Having **two copies** of each chromosome — one from each parent — so you carry **two alleles** for every gene |
| **Genotype** | The alleles an organism carries, written with letters (e.g., *Aa*) |
| **Phenotype** | The physical trait you can observe (e.g., "brown eyes") |
| **Homozygous** | Two identical alleles (*AA* or *aa*) |
| **Heterozygous** | Two different alleles (*Aa*) — also called a **carrier** if the trait is recessive |
| **Dominant** | The allele expressed when at least one copy is present (capital letter, e.g., **A**) |
| **Recessive** | The allele expressed only when two copies are present (lowercase letter, e.g., **a**) |
| **Punnett Square** | A grid used to predict the offspring of a genetic cross |

### Check Your Understanding

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. When we write a genotype like *Aa* or *Bb*, the capital letter and the lowercase letter each represent a different allele of the same gene. Humans are diploid, meaning they carry two copies of each gene. In your own words, explain what the genotype *Aa* tells you — what does the capital *A* represent, what does the lowercase *a* represent, and why are there exactly two letters?**

{fill:textarea rows=3}

**2. If someone has the genotype *Bb*, are they homozygous or heterozygous?**

{fill:text}

**3. An organism with genotype *aa* shows the recessive trait. What genotype(s) would show the dominant trait?**

{fill:text}

**4. What is the difference between a genotype and a phenotype?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**5. Why is a person with genotype *Aa* called a "carrier" for a recessive condition?**

## Part 2: Coin Toss — Modeling Allele Segregation

> **Learning Goal:** See how random chance determines which allele a parent passes on.

When a parent with genotype **Aa** makes sperm or egg cells, each cell randomly gets either the **A** or the **a**. This is like flipping a coin.

### Procedure

1. Get **two coins**. One = Father (Aa). One = Mother (Aa).
2. Flip both coins **20 times**. Record each result below.
   - **Heads** = Dominant allele (**A**)
   - **Tails** = Recessive allele (**a**)
   - Both Heads = **AA** · One of each = **Aa** · Both Tails = **aa**

### Data

<!-- lab:data-table rows=3 title="Genotype Tally (20 Tosses)" -->
| Genotype | Tally | Count | Percentage (Count ÷ 20 × 100) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AA | {fill:text} | {fill:number} | {fill:number}% |
| Aa | {fill:text} | {fill:number} | {fill:number}% |
| aa | {fill:text} | {fill:number} | {fill:number}% |
<!-- /lab:data-table -->

### Questions

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. The expected ratio for Aa × Aa is 25% AA, 50% Aa, 25% aa. How close were your results?**

{fill:textarea rows=2}

**2. Would your results be closer to the expected ratio if you flipped 100 times? Why?**

## Part 3: Punnett Squares — Albinism

> **Learning Goal:** Use Punnett squares to predict offspring for a real human trait.

**Albinism** is a recessive condition where the body produces little or no melanin pigment.

- **A** = Normal pigmentation (dominant)
- **a** = Albinism (recessive)

### Cross 1: AA × aa

A man with normal pigmentation (**AA**) has children with a woman who has albinism (**aa**).

**Draw the Punnett square in the box below:**

{fill:drawing height=200}

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Genotype of all offspring:** {fill:text}

**Phenotype of all offspring:** {fill:text}

**Can any child from this cross have albinism? Why or why not?**
{fill:textarea rows=2}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

### Cross 2: Aa × Aa

Two people who are both **carriers** (Aa) have children together.

**Draw the Punnett square in the box below:**

{fill:drawing height=200}

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**Expected genotypic ratio:**

- AA: {fill:text}%
- Aa: {fill:text}%
- aa: {fill:text}%

**What fraction of their children could have albinism?** {fill:text}

**What fraction would be carriers (Aa) but look normal?** {fill:text}
<!-- /lab:reflection -->

## Part 4: Punnett Squares — Sickle Cell Trait

> **Learning Goal:** Apply Punnett squares to another real human genetic condition.

**Sickle cell disease** is an autosomal recessive condition affecting hemoglobin in red blood cells.

- **H** = Normal hemoglobin (dominant)
- **h** = Sickle cell hemoglobin (recessive)
- **HH** = Unaffected
- **Hh** = Carrier (sickle cell *trait* — usually healthy)
- **hh** = Sickle cell *disease*

### Cross: Hh × Hh

Both parents are carriers for sickle cell trait.

**Draw the Punnett square in the box below:**

{fill:drawing height=200}

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. What is the probability their child will have sickle cell disease (hh)?** {fill:text}

**2. What is the probability their child will be a carrier (Hh)?** {fill:text}

**3. What is the probability their child will be completely unaffected (HH)?** {fill:text}

**4. If this couple has 4 children, how many would you *expect* to be carriers? (This is a prediction, not a guarantee.)**

## Part 5: Family Pedigree — Tracing a Trait Through Generations

> **Learning Goal:** Read and draw a pedigree chart to trace how a trait is inherited in a real family.

A **pedigree** is a diagram that shows how a trait passes through a family. Here are the standard symbols:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| □ | Male |
| ○ | Female |
| ■ / ● | Affected (has the trait) |
| □─○ | Mated pair |
| Vertical line down | Their children |

### Scenario: Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an **autosomal recessive** condition (genotype **ff**).

- **F** = Normal (dominant)
- **f** = Cystic fibrosis (recessive)

Read the family description, then draw the pedigree in the box below.

**Generation I (Grandparents):** Frank (unaffected) and Gina (unaffected) have three children.

**Generation II (Their children):**

- **Maria** (unaffected) — marries **Tom** (unaffected). They have 2 children.
- **Carlos** — has cystic fibrosis.
- **Anna** (unaffected) — no children yet.

**Generation III (Grandchildren):**

- Maria and Tom's daughter **Lily** (unaffected)
- Maria and Tom's son **Sam** (unaffected)

### Draw the Pedigree

Use the standard symbols above. Squares for males, circles for females. Shade in anyone who is affected. Label each person with their name.

### Pedigree Analysis

<!-- lab:reflection -->
**1. Carlos has cystic fibrosis (ff). He got one *f* allele from Frank and one from Gina. What must Frank and Gina's genotypes be?**

{fill:text}

**2. Frank and Gina appear healthy but each carry one recessive allele. What is the term for this?**

{fill:text}

**3. What are Maria's possible genotypes? (There are two options.)**

{fill:text}

**4. If Maria is a carrier (Ff) and Tom is also a carrier (Ff), what is the probability that their child would have cystic fibrosis?**

{fill:text}

**5. Draw the Punnett square for Ff × Ff in the box below to support your answer.**

{fill:drawing height=200}

**6. Looking at your pedigree, could you tell just by looking at appearances that Frank and Gina were carriers? Why is this important for genetic counseling?**
