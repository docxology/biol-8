# Module 13: Regulation of Gene Expression
## Keys to Success & Study Guide

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1.  **Explain** the organization and regulation of prokaryotic operons (lac and trp).
2.  **Identify** the multiple levels of eukaryotic gene regulation (chromatin to protein).
3.  **Differentiate** between types of DNA mutations and predict their effects.
4.  **Discuss** the implications of epigenetic inheritance.

### Key Terminology Checklist
*Define these terms in your own words to ensure mastery.*

- [ ] **Promoter**: The DNA region where RNA polymerase binds.
- [ ] **Operator**: A DNA segment that controls access to the structural genes.
- [ ] **Repressor**: A protein that binds the operator and blocks transcription.
- [ ] **Epigenetics**: Heritable changes in gene expression without alterations to the DNA sequence.
- [ ] **Mutagen**: A physical or chemical agent that causes DNA mutations.
- [ ] **Barr Body**: An inactivated X chromosome in female mammalian cells.

### Concept Check
#### 1. Operons
*   **Question**: Why do bacteria use operons?
*   **Key Answer**: Operons coordinate the expression of functionally related genes under a single promoter and operator. This enables rapid, coordinated responses to environmental changes.

#### 2. Chromatin Remodeling
*   **Question**: How does chromatin structure affect gene expression?
*   **Key Answer**:
    *   **Heterochromatin** (tightly condensed): Genes are inaccessible and silenced.
    *   **Euchromatin** (loosely condensed): Genes are accessible for transcription.
    *   Histone acetylation loosens chromatin (activation); methylation often tightens it (silencing).

#### 3. Mutation Types
*   **Question**: What is a point mutation?
*   **Key Answer**: A single nucleotide change. Types include:
    *   **Silent**: No amino acid change (codon redundancy).
    *   **Missense**: Different amino acid.
    *   **Nonsense**: Premature stop codon.

#### 4. X-Inactivation
*   **Question**: Why do calico cats have patchy fur?
*   **Key Answer**: The fur color gene is X-linked. In females (XX), one X is randomly inactivated in each cell during development, creating a mosaic pattern.
