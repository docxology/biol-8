# Module 15: Darwin and Evolution
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Darwin's Theory**
    *   Define natural selection.
    *   What is "descent with modification"?
    *   Does an individual evolve, or does a population evolve?

2.  **Requirements for Natural Selection**
    *   Explain why heritable variation, competition, and differential survival are necessary for evolution.

3.  **Fitness**
    *   In evolutionary biology, what does "fitness" mean? (Reproductive success)

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Anatomical Evidence**
    *   Differentiate homologous structures (common ancestry) from analogous structures (convergent evolution).
    *   What is a vestigial structure? Provide a human example.

5.  **Molecular Evidence**
    *   All life uses DNA and the same genetic code. How does this support common ancestry?
    *   If human hemoglobin is more similar to chimpanzee hemoglobin than dog hemoglobin, what does this imply?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Natural Selection in Action**
    *   **Scenario**: A farmer sprays pesticide. 99% of insects die. Next year, only 50% die.
    *   Did the insects "learn" resistance? Explain using natural selection.

7.  **Artificial Selection**
    *   Humans bred wolves into diverse dog breeds. How is artificial selection similar to and different from natural selection?
