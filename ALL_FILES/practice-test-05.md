## Part A: Multiple Choice

**1.** An alternate form of a gene is called a(n):
A) Chromosome
B) Allele
C) Genotype
D) Phenotype

**2.** If an individual has two identical alleles for a trait (e.g., **AA**), they are:
A) Heterozygous
B) Homozygous dominant
C) Homozygous recessive
D) Hemizygous

**3.** The physical appearance of an organism (such as tall or short) is its:
A) Genotype
B) Phenotype
C) Allele
D) Karyotype

**4.** An organism with two different alleles for a trait (e.g., **Aa**) is:
A) Homozygous
B) Heterozygous
C) Dominant
D) Recessive

**5.** In a cross between a heterozygous tall plant (Tt) and a short plant (tt), what is the probability of having short offspring?
A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 100%

**6.** In a cross between two heterozygous individuals (Aa × Aa), what fraction of offspring will show the recessive phenotype?
A) 1/4
B) 1/2
C) 3/4
D) All

**7.** Which inheritance pattern results in an intermediate phenotype (e.g., Red × White = Pink)?
A) Complete dominance
B) Codominance
C) Incomplete dominance
D) X-linked inheritance

**8.** Blood type AB (genotype I^A I^B) is an example of:
A) Incomplete dominance
B) Codominance
C) Simple dominance
D) Sex-linked inheritance

**9.** Traits controlled by genes on the X chromosome are called:
A) Autosomal traits
B) Sex-linked traits
C) Polygenic traits
D) Multiple alleles

**10.** Why are X-linked recessive disorders (like color blindness) more common in males?
A) Males have two X chromosomes
B) Males have only one X chromosome, so there is no dominant allele to mask the recessive one
C) The Y chromosome carries the disorder
D) Males have weaker immune systems

**11.** A chart that tracks a trait across generations in a family is called a:
A) Karyotype
B) Punnett Square
C) Pedigree
D) Genetic map

**12.** In a pedigree, a filled-in circle represents:
A) An affected male
B) An affected female
C) A carrier
D) An unaffected individual

**13.** A cross between a red flower (RR) and a white flower (WW) produces all pink offspring. If two pink flowers (RW × RW) are crossed, the phenotypic ratio is:
A) All pink
B) 1 Red : 2 Pink : 1 White
C) 3 Red : 1 White
D) 1 Red : 1 White

**14.** Which of the following genotypes would be considered homozygous recessive?
A) AA
B) Aa
C) aa
D) AB

**15.** Gregor Mendel is known as the "Father of":
A) Evolution
B) Genetics
C) Anatomy
D) Microbiology

**16.** A woman who is a carrier for color blindness (X^C X^c) and a man with normal vision (X^C Y) have children. What is the probability their sons will be color blind?
A) 0%
B) 25%
C) 50%
D) 100%

## Part B: Fill in the Blank

**17.** Gregor Mendel's work with _____________________ plants laid the foundation for genetics.

**18.** The physical appearance of an organism is its _____________________, while its genetic makeup is its _____________________.

**19.** In a heterozygote, the allele that is masked (hidden) is called _____________________.

**20.** A cross involving two traits (e.g., AaBb × AaBb) is called a _____________________ cross.

**21.** A trait determined by multiple genes (such as skin color or height) is an example of _____________________ inheritance.
