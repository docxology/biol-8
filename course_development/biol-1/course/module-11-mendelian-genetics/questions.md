# Module 11: Mendelian Genetics
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Mendel's Laws**
    *   Define the Law of Segregation.
    *   Define the Law of Independent Assortment. Does the inheritance of one trait affect another?

2.  **Genotype vs. Phenotype**
    *   Explain the difference between homozygous dominant (AA), heterozygous (Aa), and homozygous recessive (aa).
    *   If "A" = Tall and "a" = Short, what is the phenotype of "Aa"?

3.  **Complex Patterns**
    *   Differentiate between incomplete dominance and codominance.
    *   Explain polygenic inheritance using human height or skin color as an example.

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Monohybrid Cross**
    *   In peas, Purple flowers (P) are dominant to White flowers (p).
    *   Perform a cross: Pp × Pp. What are the expected genotypic and phenotypic ratios?

5.  **Blood Typing**
    *   Human blood type involves multiple alleles (Iᴬ, Iᴮ, i) and codominance.
    *   Can a Type A mother and Type B father have a Type O child? Show the Punnett square.

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Pedigree Analysis**
    *   Two unaffected parents have an affected child. Is the trait likely dominant or recessive?

7.  **Nature vs. Nurture**
    *   Hydrangea flower color changes with soil pH. Does genotype always strictly determine phenotype? How does the environment modify gene expression?
