<h1>Module 01: Exploring Life Science — Keys to Success</h1>
<h2>Key Learning Objectives</h2>
<h3>1. Define and Describe Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define what constitutes a living organism</li>
<li>Identify the characteristics shared by all living things (organization, metabolism, homeostasis, growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, adaptation)</li>
<li>Distinguish between living and non-living matter</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Understand the Scientific Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Describe the steps of the scientific method</li>
<li>Differentiate between hypothesis, theory, and scientific law</li>
<li>Design simple experiments with appropriate controls and variables</li>
<li>Analyze and interpret experimental data</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Levels of Biological Organization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify and order the hierarchical levels of life (atom → molecule → organelle → cell → tissue → organ → organ system → organism → population → community → ecosystem → biosphere)</li>
<li>Explain the relationship between structure and function at each level</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Basic Principles of Evolution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define evolution and natural selection</li>
<li>Explain how adaptations arise in populations</li>
<li>Understand why biodiversity is important for ecosystem health</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Core Themes in Biology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recognize the interconnection between organisms and their environment</li>
<li>Appreciate the unity and diversity of life</li>
<li>Understand energy flow and matter cycling in biological systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Study Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a visual hierarchy</strong> of the levels of organization with examples at each level</li>
<li><strong>Practice designing experiments</strong> with clear hypotheses, variables, and controls</li>
<li><strong>Connect concepts</strong> to everyday observations in nature</li>
<li><strong>Use flashcards</strong> for key terminology and definitions</li>
</ol>
