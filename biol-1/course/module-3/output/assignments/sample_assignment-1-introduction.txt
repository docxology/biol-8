Assignment 1: Genetics Problems

Instructions

Solve the following genetics problems. Show all work, including Punnett squares.

Problem 1: Monohybrid Cross (20 points)

In humans, brown eyes (B) are dominant to blue eyes (b). A brown-eyed man marries a blue-eyed woman. They have four children, all with brown eyes. What are the possible genotypes of the parents? Show your work.

Problem 2: Dihybrid Cross (25 points)

In pea plants, round seeds (R) are dominant to wrinkled (r), and yellow seeds (Y) are dominant to green (y). Cross a plant that is heterozygous for both traits (RrYy) with a plant that is homozygous recessive for both traits (rryy). What are the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of the offspring?

Problem 3: Sex-Linked Inheritance (20 points)

Hemophilia is a sex-linked recessive disorder. A woman who is a carrier for hemophilia marries a man with hemophilia. What is the probability that:
A son will have hemophilia?
A daughter will have hemophilia?
A daughter will be a carrier?

Problem 4: Pedigree Analysis (20 points)

Analyze the provided pedigree chart and determine:
The mode of inheritance
The genotype of each individual
The probability that the next child will have the trait

Problem 5: Application (15 points)

Choose a genetic disorder and explain:
How it is inherited
Symptoms and effects
Current treatment options
Genetic counseling considerations
