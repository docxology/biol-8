# Software Development Rules

## Real Methods Policy

**Always use real methods and implementations - no mocks, stubs, or fake methods.**

### Implementation Requirements
- All functions must use real library implementations (weasyprint, gTTS, requests, etc.)
- All file operations must use real file system operations
- All validation must use real validation logic
- All API integrations must use real API clients with proper error handling

### Testing Requirements
- All tests must use real file operations and real library calls
- No mocks, stubs, or fake methods in test code
- External API tests must validate structure/logic, not actual API calls
- Integration tests that require external services must be clearly marked

### Code Quality
- Type hints for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Error handling with appropriate exceptions
- Modular, reusable code structure

### Documentation
- All documentation must emphasize real implementations
- Function signatures must document real method calls
- Examples must use real code, not mocked examples
