# Module 17: Speciation and Macroevolution
## Comprehension & Critical Thinking Questions

### Part 1: Core Concepts
1.  **Species Concepts**
    *   Define the Biological Species Concept. What is the key criterion?
    *   Why is this concept difficult to apply to fossils or asexual organisms? What is the Morphological Species Concept?

2.  **Reproductive Barriers**
    *   Classify the following as pre-zygotic or post-zygotic:
        *   Temporal isolation (different mating seasons)
        *   Gametic isolation (sperm cannot fertilize egg)
        *   Hybrid sterility (mule)

3.  **Modes of Speciation**
    *   Compare allopatric and sympatric speciation. Which requires a geographic barrier?

### Part 2: Application
4.  **Adaptive Radiation**
    *   **Scenario**: Finches colonize a volcanic archipelago with many unoccupied niches.
    *   Explain how one ancestral species can rapidly diversify into many species.

5.  **Convergent Evolution**
    *   Sharks (fish) and dolphins (mammals) have similar body shapes.
    *   Did they inherit this shape from a common ancestor, or evolve it independently? What selective pressure drove this?

### Part 3: Analysis & Evaluation
6.  **Macroevolutionary Pacing**
    *   Contrast gradualism (slow, steady change) with punctuated equilibrium (stasis interrupted by rapid change).
    *   Which model better explains gaps in the fossil record?

7.  **Evolution Has No Goal**
    *   Critique the statement: "Evolution drives organisms toward perfection."
    *   Is evolution goal-directed, or does it respond to immediate environmental pressures?
