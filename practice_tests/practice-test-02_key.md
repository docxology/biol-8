## Part A: Multiple Choice Answers

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|:---:|:------:|-------------|
| 1 | B | Proteins float within a flexible phospholipid bilayer — the "fluid mosaic" |
| 2 | C | Hydrophobic tails face inward, away from water, toward each other |
| 3 | B | Cholesterol buffers membrane fluidity — prevents too rigid or too fluid |
| 4 | B | Integral (transmembrane) proteins span the entire bilayer |
| 5 | B | Glycoproteins serve as identification markers for cell recognition |
| 6 | C | Selectively permeable = allows some substances through but not others |
| 7 | B | Simple diffusion moves down the gradient, no energy, no proteins needed |
| 8 | C | Facilitated diffusion is passive but uses channel or carrier proteins |
| 9 | B | Osmosis = water movement toward higher solute concentration across a membrane |
| 10 | C | Hypotonic = less solute outside, water enters cell → swelling/lysis |
| 11 | B | Hypertonic = more solute outside, water leaves → plasmolysis in plant cells |
| 12 | C | Na⁺/K⁺ pump uses ATP to move ions against their gradient = active transport |
| 13 | C | Phagocytosis = "cell eating," engulfing large particles |
| 14 | B | Catabolism breaks down molecules and releases energy |
| 15 | C | ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the cell's energy currency |
| 16 | C | Energy stored in phosphate-phosphate bonds (phosphoanhydride bonds) |
| 17 | B | Enzymes lower activation energy, making reactions proceed faster |
| 18 | B | Induced fit = active site adjusts shape to bind substrate more tightly |
| 19 | B | Noncompetitive inhibitor binds elsewhere, distorting the active site |
| 20 | B | Feedback inhibition = end product shuts down an earlier enzyme in the pathway |
| 21 | B | Glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + ATP (cellular respiration summary) |
| 22 | C | Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm (does not require mitochondria) |
| 23 | B | ETC is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane |
| 24 | C | Fermentation produces ATP without oxygen (anaerobic) |
| 25 | D | Aerobic respiration yields ~36-38 ATP per glucose |

## Part C: Short Answer Key

**36. Passive vs. Active Transport:**

- Passive transport moves substances down their concentration gradient without energy (e.g., osmosis, simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion)
- Active transport moves substances against their concentration gradient and requires ATP (e.g., sodium-potassium pump, endocytosis)
- Key distinction: energy requirement and direction relative to gradient

**37. Tonicity and Animal Cells:**

- Isotonic solution: water moves in and out equally; cell maintains normal shape
- Hypertonic solution: water leaves the cell; cell shrinks (crenation)
- Hypotonic solution: water enters the cell; cell swells and may burst (lysis)

**38. Enzyme Function and Denaturation:**

- Enzymes have an active site that binds a specific substrate (induced fit model)
- They lower the activation energy needed for the reaction, speeding it up without being consumed
- Denaturation (from extreme heat or pH) unfolds the enzyme, distorting the active site so the substrate can no longer bind — the enzyme loses function

**39. Three Stages of Cellular Respiration:**

- Glycolysis (cytoplasm): splits glucose into 2 pyruvate molecules; produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH
- Citric acid cycle (mitochondrial matrix): breaks down pyruvate derivatives; produces 2 ATP, NADH, and FADH2
- Electron transport chain (inner mitochondrial membrane): uses NADH and FADH2 to produce ~32-34 ATP via chemiosmosis

**40. Fermentation Comparison:**

- Lactic acid fermentation: pyruvate → lactic acid; occurs in muscle cells during intense exercise
- Alcoholic fermentation: pyruvate → ethanol + CO₂; occurs in yeast and some bacteria
- Both produce only 2 ATP per glucose (from glycolysis only) because without oxygen, the electron transport chain cannot run — that's where the vast majority (~34) of ATP would normally be produced
